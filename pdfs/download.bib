abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an important technology for enabling the Physical Web. This paper examines the use of BLE beacons for the discovery of content in mobile guides implemented as Progressive Web Applications. Cilogi is a framework for the creation of guides that run on mobile devices. BLE beacons are small devices that broadcast their identity to nearby mobile devices using much less energy than classic Bluetooth devices. The new Eddystone message format broadcasts enables broadcasting of a URL. This makes BLE beacons an alternative way of communicating the URL of individual pages of a mobile guide in an exhibition setting. This paper examines whether BLE beacons are a viable alternative to existing means of local content discovery. We conclude that BLE beacons are satisfactory for initial discovery although differences exist in platform integration. We make recommendations of how the technology can be developed to enable installed web applications to notify users when relevant beacons are discovered and propose that further work investigates user acceptance on a larger scale.},

abstract = {Crowdsensing technologies are rapidly evolving and are expected to be utilized on commercial applications such as location-based services. Crowdsensing collects sensory data from daily activities of users without burdening users, and the data size is expected to grow into a population scale. However, quality of service is difficult to ensure for commercial use. Incentive design in crowdsensing with monetary rewards or gamifications is, therefore, attracting attention for motivating participants to collect data to increase data quantity. In contrast, we propose Steered Crowdsensing, which controls the incentives of users by using the game elements on location-based services for directly improving the quality of service rather than data size. For a feasibility study of steered crowdsensing, we deployed a crowdsensing system focusing on application scenarios of building processes on wireless indoor localization systems. In the results, steered crowdsensing realized deployments faster than non-steered crowdsensing while having half as many data.},

abstract = {We are becoming increasingly surrounded by smart and connected devices, popularly known as the Internet of Things. The emerging user interface paradigm for many such things eschews physical buttons, knobs, and displays in favor of virtual interfaces that are downloaded from the web and rendered on remote platforms---like smartphones. However, such smartphone app-based interfaces often require tedious discovery and installation, as well as device discovery, pairing, and configuration before a user can interact with a nearby device. Requiring an explicit app install for each new device type scales poorly with device growth, and particularly hinders casual interactions with ambient devices. Instead of the high-friction, walled-garden approach now taking root, we propose name, a physical web browser that provides a seamless, scalable approach to browsing and interacting with nearby things. name leverages multiple network patterns and modern web technologies to provide users with rich device interfaces, even for devices under network or power constraints. We argue that this approach scales better and that it provides more intuitive and natural functionality for both users and developers. This demo presents the basic concept, allows others to experience our preliminary implementation, and raises several open research questions.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has been considered as a promising approach for large scale urban data collection, but has also posed new challenging problems such as incentivization and quality control. Among the other incentivization approaches, posted pricing has been widely adopted by commercial systems due to the reason that it naturally achieves truthfulness and fairness and is easy to be implemented. However, the fundamental problem of how to set a right posted price in crowdsensing systems remains largely open. In this paper, we study a quality-aware Bayesian pricing problem for mobile crowdsensing where the users' sensing costs and qualities for participating in crowdsensing are drawn from known distributions learned from historical information, and our goal is to choose an appropriate posted price to recruit a group of participants with reasonable sensing qualities for robust crowdsensing, while the total expected payment is minimized. We show that our problem is NP-hard and has close ties with the well known Poisson Binomial Distributions (PBD). To solve our problem, we first discover some nontrivial submodular properties of PBD, which have not been reported before, then we propose a novel "ironing method" that transforms our problem from a non-submodular optimization problem into a submodular one by leveraging the newly discovered properties of PBD. Finally, with the ironing method, an approximate algorithm with provable performance ratio is provided, and we also conduct extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {In this paper we focus on mobile crowdsensing applications for community sensing where sensors and mobile devices jointly collect and share data of interest to observe and measure phenomena over a larger geographic area. Such applications, e.g., environmental monitoring or crowdsourced traffic monitoring, involve numerous individuals that on the one hand continuously contribute sensed data to application servers, and on the other hand consume the information of interest to observe a phenomenon typically in their close vicinity. Energy-efficient and context-aware orchestration of the sensing process with data transmission from sensors through mobile devices into the cloud, as well as from the cloud to mobile devices such that information of interest is served to users in real-time, is essential for such applications, primarily due to battery limitations of both mobile devices and wearable sensors. In addition, the latency of data propagation represents their key quality measure from the user's perspective. Publish/subscribe middleware offers the mechanisms to deal with those challenges: It enables selective real-time acquisition and filtering of sensor data on mobile devices, efficient continuous processing of large data volumes within the cloud, and near real-time delivery of notifications to mobile devices. This paper presents our implementation of a publish/subscribe middleware system which is tailored to the requirements of mobile and resource-constrained environments with a goal to reduce the overall energy consumption in such environments, and proposes a general architecture for mobile crowdsensing applications. We demonstrate the usability of both the architecture and middleware through our application for air quality monitoring, and discuss the energy footprint of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {Fueled by the widespread adoption of sensor-enabled smartphones, mobile crowdsourcing is an area of rapid innovation. Many crowd-powered sensor systems are now part of our daily life -- for example, providing highway congestion information. However, participation in these systems can easily expose users to a significant drain on already limited mobile battery resources. For instance, the energy burden of sampling certain sensors (such as WiFi or GPS) can quickly accumulate to levels users are unwilling to bear. Crowd system designers must minimize the negative energy side-effects of participation if they are to acquire and maintain large-scale user populations. To address this challenge, we propose Piggyback CrowdSensing (PCS), a system for collecting mobile sensor data from smartphones that lowers the energy overhead of user participation. Our approach is to collect sensor data by exploiting Smartphone App Opportunities -- that is, those times when smartphone users place phone calls or use applications. In these situations, the energy needed to sense is lowered because the phone need no longer be woken from an idle sleep state just to collect data. Similar savings are also possible when the phone either performs local sensor computation or uploads the data to the cloud. To efficiently use these sporadic opportunities, PCS builds a lightweight, user-specific prediction model of smartphone app usage. PCS uses this model to drive a decision engine that lets the smartphone locally decide which app opportunities to exploit based on expected energy/quality trade-offs. We evaluate PCS by analyzing a large-scale dataset (containing 1,320 smartphone users) and building an end-to-end crowdsourcing application that constructs an indoor WiFi localization database. Our findings show that PCS can effectively collect large-scale mobile sensor datasets (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, audio, image) from users while using less energy (up to 90{\%} depending on the scenario) compared to a representative collection of existing approaches.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of mobile crowdsourcing platforms has enabled crowd workers to accept jobs wherever/whenever they are, and also provides opportunity for task requesters to order time/location specific tasks to workers. Since workers on mobile platforms are working on the go, the situation of the workers is expected to influence their performance. However, the effects of mobile worker situations to task performance is an uninvestigated area. In this paper, our research question is, " do worker situations affect task completion, price and quality on mobile crowdsourcing platforms? " We draw on economics and psychology research to examine whether worker situations such as busyness, fatigue and presence of companions affect their performance. Our three-week between-subjects field experiment revealed that worker busyness caused 30.1{\%} relative decrease of task completion rate. Mean accepted task price increased by 7.6{\%} when workers are with companions. Worker fatigue caused 37.4{\%} relative decrease of task quality.},

Given the significant increase in mobile phone penetration and the expansion of existing mobile network capacity, e.g., based on heterogeneous networks (HetNets), new forms of crowdsourcing can be conceived that leverage the mobile and ubiquitous user base. This paper aims to explore some of the opportunities and challenges of new approaches to mobile and ubiquitous crowdsourcing solutions. In addition, we present the conceptual architecture of a context-aware mobile crowdsourcing platform that brings together 'crowdsourcers' as service requesters and 'mobile workers' as service providers.},

First, we developed a smartphone application to capture data on places, social context and nightlife activities, and to record mobile videos capturing the ambiance of places. Second, we conducted an " in-the-wild " study with more than 200 participants over a period of three months in two Swiss cities, resulting in a total of 1,394 unique place visits and 843 videos that spread across place categories (including personal homes and public parks), social and ambiance variables. Finally, we investigated the use of automatic ambiance features to estimate the loudness and brightness of places at scale, and found that while features are reliable with respect to video content, videos do not always re-flect the place ambiance reported by people in-situ. We believe that the developed methodology provides an opportunity to understand the physical mobility, activities, and social context of youth as they experience different aspects of nightlife.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing applications rely on crowds of contributors who are willing to carry out certain tasks of interest. This willingness varies widely across users and tasks and (monetary) incentives are often engaged to strengthen it or make up for its total absence. These incentives need to carefully account for the highly non-homogeneous response of users to external motivation. We propose a framework that explicitly accounts for the implicit uncertainty about the eventual participation and contributions of users. In the framework, the impact of incentives on the user choice to contribute or not is modeled probabilistically. First, we formulate a convex optimization problem for incentive allocation with the goal of achieving maximum expected quality while taking into account task budget limitations and constraints related to the physical locations of users and tasks. We then propose an iterative algorithm to alleviate the complexity of the original problem with two basic steps: an allocation step that applies incentive allocation to a set of available contributors; and a refinement step that revokes portions of the allocated incentives. We study the performance characteristics of our algorithm by comparing it to a default solver for convex optimization problems. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing is a burgeoning concept that allows smart cities to
leverage the sensing power and ubiquitous nature of mobile devices in
order to capture and map phenomena of common interest. At the core of
any successful mobile crowdsensing application is active user
participation, without which the system is of no value in sensing the
phenomenon of interest. A major challenge militating against widespread
use and adoption of mobile crowdsensing applications is the issue of how
to identify the most appropriate incentive mechanism for adequately and
efficiently motivating participants. This paper reviews literature on
incentive mechanisms for mobile crowdsensing and proposes the concept of
SPECTRUM as a guide for inferring the most appropriate type of incentive
suited to any given crowdsensing task. Furthermore, the paper highlights
research challenges and areas where additional studies related to the
different factors outlined in the concept of SPECTRUM are needed to
improve citizen participation in mobile crowdsensing. It is envisaged
that the broad range of factors covered in SPECTRUM will enable smart
cities to efficiently engage citizens in large-scale crowdsensing
initiatives. More importantly, the paper is expected to trigger
empirical investigations into how various factors as outlined in
SPECTRUM can influence the type of incentive mechanism that is
considered most appropriate for any given mobile crowdsensing

abstract = {Abstract The Internet of Things has enabled new services to communities in many domains, e.g. smart healthcare, environmental awareness, and public safety. These services require timely and accurate event delivery, but such in-situ deployments are often limited by the coverage of sensing/communication infrastructures. In this paper we develop effective, scalable, and realistic data collection and upload solutions using mobile data collectors in community IoT systems. Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30{\%}–60{\%} improvement in overall data utility, 30{\%} reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability.},

The countermeasures and informal and formal security analysis techniques used by the authentication and privacy preserving schemes are summarized in form of tables. Based on the categorization of the authentication and privacy models, we classify these schemes in seven types, including, handover authentication with privacy, mutual authentication with privacy, RFID authentication with privacy, deniable authentication with privacy, authentication with mutual anonymity, authentication and key agreement with privacy, and three-factor authentication with privacy. In addition, we provide a taxonomy and comparison of authentication and privacy-preserving schemes for 4G and 5G cellular networks in form of tables.

Leveraging volunteers and their mobiles as a (sensing) data collection outlet is known as Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) and poses interesting challenges, with particular regard to the management of sensing resource contributors, dealing with their subscription, random and unpredictable join and leave, and node churn.  To facilitate and expedite the (commercial) exploitation of this trend, in this paper we propose to adopt a service-oriented approach to cope with MCS application deployment into a sensing Cloud infrastructure, decoupling the MCS application domain from the infrastructure one. To this purpose we provide the building blocks for implementing such a novel take on MCS, which from a Cloud layering perspective can be identified as a platform service, i.e., an MCS as a service (MCSaaS). A prototype implementation that serves as a blueprint and a proof-of-concept of the proposed framework is presented, while an evaluation of the effectiveness of the MCSaaS paradigm has been provided using suitable mobility-related use cases for a validation of the concept, as well as a modeling approach through the adoption of generalized stochastic Petri nets.},

abstract = {Wireless energy transfer is used to fundamentally address energy management problems in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs). In such networks mobile entities traverse the network and wirelessly replenish the energy of sensor nodes. In recent research on collaborative wireless charging, the mobile entities are also allowed to charge each other. In this work, we enhance the collaborative feature by forming a hierarchical charging structure. We distinguish the Chargers in two groups, the hierarchically lower Mobile Chargers which charge sensor nodes and the hierarchically higher Special Chargers which charge Mobile Chargers. We define the Coordination Decision Problem and prove that it is NP-complete. Also, we propose a new protocol for 1-D networks which we compare with a state of the art protocol. Motivated by the improvement in 1-D networks, we propose and implement four new collaborative charging protocols for 2-D networks, in order to achieve efficient charging and improve important network properties. Our protocols are either centralized or distributed, and assume different levels of network knowledge. Extensive simulation findings demonstrate significant performance gains, with respect to non-collaborative state of the art charging methods. In particular, our protocols improve several network properties and metrics, such as the network lifetime, routing robustness, coverage and connectivity. A useful feature of our methods is that they can be suitably added on top of non-collaborative protocols to further enhance their performance.},

abstract = {Abstract  Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios.  In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudIoT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudIoT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudIoT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms–both proprietary and open source–and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet. TS  - RIS},

abstract = {Due to the pervasive diffusion of personal mobile and IoT devices, many “smart environments” (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be, among others, generators of huge amounts of data. To provide value-add services in these environments, data will have to be analysed to extract knowledge. Currently, this is typically achieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However, according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One possibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to where data is generated. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing and analysing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by (e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them accordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics services. In the specific case analysed in the paper we focus on a learning task, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity recognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we compare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud solution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show that using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to drastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable to the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows when each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific distribution of the data on the nodes.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive economic analysis for such a crowdsourced network, with the particular focus on the users' behavior analysis and the community network operator's pricing design. Specifically, we formulate the interactions between the network operator and users as a two-layer Stackelberg model, where the operator determining the pricing scheme in Layer I, and then users determining their Wi-Fi sharing schemes in Layer II. First, we analyze the user behavior in Layer II via a two-stage membership selection and network access game, for both small-scale networks and large-scale networks. Then, we design a partial price differentiation scheme for the operator in Layer I, which generalizes both the complete price differentiation scheme and the single pricing scheme (i.e., no price differentiation). We show that the proposed partial pricing scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between the revenue and the implementation complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that when using the partial pricing scheme with only two prices, we can increase the operator's revenue up to 124.44{\{}{\%}{\}} comparing with the single pricing scheme, and can achieve an average of 80{\{}{\%}{\}} of the maximum operator revenue under the complete price differentiation scheme. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

It is demonstrated that in some respects, crowdsourced data and laboratory data show similar results within their own category, but that at the same time a statistical comparison between the two measurement configurations is difficult due to the significant amount of noisy (outlier) data in the crowdsourced case.},

We propose a novel model for spatial task assignment in mobile crowd sensing that uses a dynamic and adaptive data driven scheme to assign moving participants with uncertain trajectories to sensing tasks, in a near-optimal manner. Our scheme is based on building a mobility model from publicly available trajectory history and estimating posterior location values using noisy/uncertain measurements upon which initial tasking assignments are made. These assignments may be refined locally (using exact information) and used by participants to steer their future data collection, which completes the feedback loop.

abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing has emerged as a new paradigm for solving problems in the physical world with the help of human workers. A major challenge in spatial crowdsourcing is to assign reliable workers to nearby tasks. The goal of such task assignment process is to maximize the task completion in the face of uncertainty. This process is further complicated when tasks arrivals are dynamic and worker reliability is unknown. Recent research proposals have tried to address the challenge of dynamic task assignment. Yet the majority of the proposals do not consider the dynamism of tasks and workers. They also make the unrealistic assumptions of known deterministic or probabilistic workers' reliabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for dynamic task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. The proposed approach combines bi-objective optimization with combinatorial multi-armed bandits. We formulate an online optimization problem to maximize task reliability and minimize travel costs in spatial crowdsourcing. We propose the distance-reliability ratio (DRR) algorithm based on a combinatorial fractional programming approach. The DRR algorithm reduces travel costs by 80{\%} while maximizing reliability when compared to existing algorithms. We extend the DRR algorithm for the scenario when worker reliabilities are unknown. We propose a novel algorithm (DRR-UCB) that uses an interval estimation heuristic to approximate worker reliabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the DRR-UCB achieves high reliability in the face of uncertainty. The proposed approach is particularly suited for real-life dynamic spatial crowdsourcing scenarios. This approach is generalizable to the similar problems in other areas in expert systems. First, it encompasses online assignment problems when the objective function is a ratio of two linear functions. Second, it considers situations when intelligent and repeated assignment decisions are needed under uncertainty.},

abstract = {Abstract Urban infrastructure safety information collection and investigation from public participants has become a trend in the era of big data. Mobile crowdsensing has facilitated ubiquitous mobile sensing applications between humans and the surrounding physical world as a convenient and economical sensing technology. This study presents an urban infrastructure safety monitoring system, known as Urban Safety, which makes urban infrastructure damage information collection possible for public participants, and allows monitoring and emergency evaluation in the field of disaster prevention and mitigation. Firstly, the Urban Safety system is presented as a system that allows integration of service-oriented architectures with resource optimization mechanisms for crowdsensing. Additionally, an Urban Safety application (app) is developed and presented based on the Android platform. The app acts as a sensor to collect urban data, such as structural acceleration, structural deformation, questionnaires, and images, and implements disaster emergency communications without the use of a network. It then uploads collected data to a website. Subsequently, the urban safety database can be established after the processing of sensed data uploaded by the user. Additionally, verification experiments were carried out at the Dalian University of Technology (DLUT), including displacement monitoring, bridge cable acceleration measurements, and image collection of the DLUT campus buildings. Finally, the experimental results show the feasible and effective use of Urban Safety for safety information monitoring of urban infrastructures.},

abstract = {Abstract Participatory Sensing (PS) systems rely essentially on users' willingness to dedicate their devices' resources (energy, processing time..) to contribute high-quality data about various phenomena. In this paper, we study the critical issue of participants' recruitment in PS systems in the aim of minimizing the overall sensing time. First, we design the users' arrival and acceptance/rejection models. Further, we introduce two variants of task assignment mechanisms; without and with incentives. In the former model, we enhance our proposed scheme, P-MATA, for preferences and mobility-aware task assignment, by introducing a logit regressing-based preferences model. Thus, we estimate the users' acceptance probabilities as function of the number and loads of sensing tasks. We incorporate rewards as a third attribute in the second variant of assignment scheme and propose two different incentivizing policies to study their impact on enhancing users' acceptance. Incentives are either task priority-based or data quality-based. All proposed algorithms adopt a greedy-based selection strategy and address the minimization of the average makespan of all sensing tasks. We conduct extensive performance evaluation based on real traces while varying the number of tasks and associated workloads. Results proved that incentivizing participants has intensified their commitment by achieving lower average makespan and higher number of delegated tasks. Moreover, quality-based incentivizing mechanism realized the better performance while minimizing the dedicated budget.},

Since the interaction of an object with a person or another object is enabled by smart sensors, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) play an important role in advancing SIoT technology. This paper proposes an improved grid-based joint routing and charging algorithm (IGRC) to implement path planning for a mobile charger, aiming to achieve energy balance in WRSNs by providing real-time charging services. The network is divided into multiple uniform square rings in IGRC. The mobile charger first starts from the center of the network and employs the Nearest Neighbor method to visit nodes in the three inner square rings, then moves along the edge of the outer rings and stops at every vertex to charge the nodes in the outer rings. The charging time allocated for each square ring can be accurately calculated based on various energy consumption rates. IGRC ensures that every node can replenish its energy before falling below a critical threshold. Simulation results demonstrate that IGRC outperforms S-CURVES(ad) and GRC in regards to energy balancing and node survival rate.},

abstract = {With the increased need for mobility and the overcrowding of cities, the area of Intelligent Transportation aims at improving the efficiency, safety, and productivity of transportation systems by relying on communication and sensing technologies. One of the main challenges faced in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) pertains to the real time collection of traffic and road related data, in a cost effective, efficient, and scalable manner. The current approaches still suffer from problems related to the energy consumption of mobile devices and overhead in terms of communications and processing. We have previously proposed the concept of Mobile Sensing as a Service (MSaaS), in which mobile owners can offer the sensing capabilities of their phones as services to other users. This ability to offer sensory data to consumers on demand can bring significant benefits to ITS and can constitute an efficient and flexible solution to the problem of real-time traffic/road data collection. In this paper, we adapt the concept of MSaaS to the area of transportation, and present an on-demand vehicular sensing framework. This framework enables a data consumer to send a sensing trigger request to a vehicular sensing platform, which matches it with the most suitable set of data collectors that would perform the sensing task, and return the data to the platform for validation and processing. The collected data is then used to infer intelligence about the city and send the required traffic information to the data consumer, in a timely manner. The proposed model and architecture were validated using a combination of prototyping and traffic simulation traces, and the obtained results are very promising.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has become a popular paradigm to collaboratively collect sensing data from pervasive mobile devices. Since the devices used for mobile crowdsensing are owned and controlled by individuals with unpredictable reliability, varied capabilities, and unknown intentions, data collected with mobile crowdsensing may be untrustworthy. In particular, a mobile crowdsensing system is subject to collusion attacks where a group of malicious participants collaboratively send fake information to mislead the system. Defending against collusion attacks requires stronger defense mechanisms not available in existing works. In this paper, we propose a new framework for improving data credibility, named FIDC, in mobile crowdsensing to alleviate the threats posed by collusion attacks. FIDC seamlessly integrates two types of correlations: the spatial correlation of sensing data and the correlation between sensing data and provenance knowledge. While both correlations have been adopted separately in previous crowdsensing systems, the exploitation of an joint effort in FIDC poses a special technical challenge to fine-tune the performance. Evaluated extensively with a public mobile crowdsensing data for temperature monitoring, FIDC outperforms existing methods with respect to false detection accuracy and overall data credibility.},

In many MCS scenarios it is desirable to give micro-payments to contributors as an incentive for their participation. However, to further encourage participants to use the system, one important requirement is protection of user privacy. In this work we present a multi-attribute reverse auction mechanism as an efficient way to offer incentives to users by allowing them to determine their own price for the data they provide, but also as a way to motivate them to submit better quality data. Our auction protocol guarantees bidders' anonymity and suggests a new rewarding mechanism that enables winners to claim their reward without being linked to the data they contributed. We have analyzed our protocol and showed that it offers strong security and privacy guarantees in all phases of the auction process, from bidding to rewarding. Additionally, we have implemented the protocol using off-the-shelf cryptographic primitives; our experiments show that the protocol is scalable, it can be applied to a large class of auctions and remains efficient from both a computation and communication point of view so that it can be run to the users' mobile devices.},

MCS aims to involve volunteering citizens in data sensing activities as they roam across the city. Notwithstanding the intense recent research activity in the MCS field, current MCS platforms still exhibit some technological limitations and do not exploit at best socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., economic/social incentives) to facilitate and encourage users' participation. In this perspective, the recent evolution of direct Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, in particular novel proximity discovery technologies, represents a relevant opportunity for MCS frameworks. This paper proposes a novel solution for improving the MCS impact and citizens' participation rate by leveraging LTE Direct, i.e., one of the most recent and promising technologies for D2D proximity discovery and local data dissemination in next generation 5G networks. Our original MCS extension supports not only novel interactions with smartphones that do not necessarily host our whole MCS client (only an LTE Direct-enabled sensing module is required), but also enables new Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where it is possible to extend smartphone sensing capabilities through D2D interactions with sensors that are dynamically determined via LTE Direct proximity discovery. To enable these new MCS features, we propose to expand the communication and data dissemination capabilities of LTE Direct via an original multi-frame transport protocol, capable of working properly also in ultra-dense scenarios with very high frame loss probability.},

Such a performance metric, here termed event goodput, is key for all random event-driven networks, ranging from surveillance and intrusion detection applications operating in time critical scenarios, to mobile and wearable crowd-sensed ecosystems, where mobile sensors are utilized by a number of different applications. When reporting the appearance of a series of possible, but unknown, phenomena, predicting which event goodput may be obtained during the planned mission time is challenging. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the network-wide problem to the analysis of the performance of individual nodes, in terms of their capability of handling given fractions of event arrivals under fixed probabilistic guarantees. This is obtained as a function of mission time, event arrival and energy consumption models of different, detection and communication schemes, all realistic.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless technologies, location based services (LBSs) are becoming popular in smart cities. Two important classes of LBSs are Nearest Neighbor (NN) queries and range queries that provide user information about the locations of point of interests (POIs) such as hospitals or restaurants. Answers of these queries are more reliable and satisfiable if they come from trustworthy crowd instead of traditional location service providers (LSPs). We introduce an approach to evaluate NN and range queries with crowdsourced data and computation that eliminates the role of an LSP. In our crowdsourced approach, a user evaluates LBSs in a group. It may happen that group members do not have knowledge of all POIs in a certain area. We present efficient algorithms to evaluate queries with accuracy guarantee in incomplete databases. Experiments show that our approach is scalable and incurs less computational overhead.},

In this paper, we study the QoS-sensitive Task Assignment (QSTA) problem for mobile crowdsensing, which involves variable tasks and flexible rewards. Each user can conduct one or more tasks, and the number of tasks assigned to each user is flexible. The reward paid to the user is related to the assigned tasks. To ensure the sensing QoS of tasks, each task might be assigned to multiple users. We prove the QSTA problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.

abstract = {In this paper we identify basic design issues of Mobile Crowdsensing Systems and investigate some characteristic challenges. We define the basic components of an MCS - the Task, the Server and the Crowd - and investigate the functions describing/governing their interactions. We identify three qualitatively different types of Tasks; (a) those whose added utility is proportional to the size of the Task, (b) those whose added utility is proportional to the progress of the Task and (c) those whose added utility is reversely proportional to the progress of the Task. For a given type of Task, and a finite Budget, the Server makes offers to the agents of the Crowd based on some Incentive Policy. On the other hand, each agent that receives an offer decides whether it will undertake the Task or not, based on the inferred cost (computed via a Cost function) and some Join Policy. In their policies, the Crowd and the Server take into account several aspects, such as the number and quality of participating agents, the progress of execution of the Task and possible network effects, present in real-life systems. We evaluate the impact and the performance of selected characteristic policies, for both the Crowd and the Server, in terms of Task execution, Budget efficiency and Workload balance of the Crowd. Experimental findings demonstrate key performance features of the various policies and indicate that some policies are more effective in enabling the Server to efficiently manage its Budget while providing satisfactory incentives to the Crowd and effectively executing the system Tasks. Interestingly, incentive policies that take into account the current crowd participation achieve a better trade-off between Task completion and budget expense.},

abstract = {The coverage problem, as a fundamental problem for almost all types of applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), has been studied for over a decade. Because of its simplicity and ease of analysis, full coverage is widely adopted in many theoretical studies. However, a full coverage requirement can be relaxed into a partial one to avoid the overuse of sensors. Moreover, sometimes full coverage is not the best way to represent some real-world applications because of its strong restrictions and its deterministic characteristics. From this view, a better way is to introduce uncertainty into coverage problems. By analyzing the characteristics of partial or probabilistic coverage problems, and comparing them with full coverage problems, this survey is helpful to establish an overview of non-deterministic coverage problems, denoted as coverage problems with uncertain properties. This survey then sketches a general research framework to solve such problems. According to the framework, we first introduce a series of basic concepts of coverage problems with uncertain properties and then summarize the relevant models, such as detection models, network models, and deployment models. Based on these models, we discuss three main objectives, namely, to maximize coverage quality, to maximize network lifetime, and to minimize the number of sensors. Next, we illustrate several solution strategies for these three objectives, such as deployment, scheduling or selection, and movement or adjustment. Then, we classify the solutions (algorithms) from different aspects, i.e., traditional and heuristic, approximation, distributed and centralized, and random algorithms. In addition, the theoretical analysis for algorithms and the platforms for simulating the numerical experiments are also summarized. Finally, we discuss future challenges and directions for research of coverage problems with uncertain properties.},

abstract = {Nowadays, noise pollution has become an outstanding problem in modern life since it affects people's health physically and psychologically. However, the means for people to understand the noise level around them are very limited. They can only get to know their environment noise through facilities such as noise measuring station or noise display board in most cases. And the traditional ways to monitor and measure noise level by distributed networks and fixed points cannot meet the need of residents and research works anymore. So developing a new way to measure and monitor noise is very urgent. Mobile crowdsensing uses the power of the masses. It is cheap and very suitable as a way to measure noise on a large scale. By implementing a prototype called NoiseCo, this paper solves the accuracy problem of measuring noise by smartphones and proves the feasibility of monitoring noise level by mobile crowdsensing. Two major problems in measuring noise level by smartphones are how to calibrate the differences between different smartphones and how to calibrate the differences between smartphones and standard noise measuring tools. By experiments, we find out that the data collected by smartphones have a linear relationship with the data collected by the noise meter and we solve the problems according to this discovery. At the same time, we analyze the importance of sampling methods and A-weighting.},

We first define the inverse correlation between the service quality and privacy level from data analytics perspectives. We then present the profit maximization models of selling standalone, complementary, and substitute services. Specifically, the closed-form solutions of the optimal privacy level and subscription fee are derived to maximize the gross profit of service providers. For interrelated people-centric services, we show that cooperation by service bundling of complementary services is profitable compared with the separate sales but detrimental for substitutes. We also show that the market value of a service bundle is correlated with the degree of contingency between the interrelated services. Finally, we incorporate the profit sharing models from game theory for dividing the bundling profit among the cooperative service providers.},

In this paper, we adopt the Signaling System No.7 (SS7) as the MCS platform since SS7 can well capture trajectories and mobility patterns of the mobile users. We collect a real-world SS7 data of 1.18 million mobile users at 3512 cell towers/sites in Xiamen, China. We first analyze this dataset and reveal important characteristics of user mobility. Then, we address a Mobile User Recruitment (MUR) problem which is crucial to all MCS systems. Given SS7 data of mobile users, a set of target cells to be sensed/covered, and recruitment cost functions of the mobile users, the MUR problem is to recruit a set of mobile users such that all the target cells are covered and the total recruitment cost is minimized. Our MUR problem is general and includes the existing problems as its special cases. We prove NP-hardness of the problem. We propose an approximation algorithm to this problem and derive the approximation ratio. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real-world SS7 dataset and results show that the proposed solution outperforms two baseline algorithms by saving 22.6{\%} and 62.9{\%} recruitment costs, respectively, on average.},

abstract = {While most of existing efforts for dynamic spectrum access have focused on spectrum sensing of a narrowband band in a given region, this paper takes a holistic perspective to determine the usage profile of wide spectrum bands over a large geographic region. Specifically, a mobile crowdsensing approach is taken to develop a spectrum-profiling framework, which leverages the wisdom of many mobile devices to accomplish large-scale sensing tasks. A key step for spectrum profiling via mobile crowdsensing is to strategically assign sensing tasks to mobile users, so as to maximize the utility of the sensing data acquired. We cast this problem as a joint sensing task and subband allocation problem for utility maximization, capturing the location-specific characteristics of spectrum sensing. Since the problem is NP-hard, we design approximation algorithms. First, we design a greedy approximation algorithm as a baseline. Our analysis shows that the proposed greedy algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 1/6, i.e., at least 1/6 of the utility obtained by the optimal allocation. Next, we design a Linear Program (LP) rounding based approximation algorithm, aiming to achieve a better approximation ratio than the greedy algorithm. We show that the propopsed LP-rounding algorithm attains an approximation ratio of 1/2 (1 - 1/e) for the general case, and further it achieves 1 - 1/e for a special case of the problem, which is the best possible approximation ratio. We also present the complexity analysis of the two proposed algorithms. We perform numerical experiments to evaluate the average performance of the the proposed algorithms.},

In order to improve performance, we often increase the number of features. However, the more features are used, the more redundancy and cost are involved correspondingly. Therefore, the number of features we selected for a specified application is a tradeoffs between the accuracy and the cost. In this paper, we model such tradeoffs between accuracy and cost as an optimization problem. Moreover, for investigating this problem, we propose to model the sensing with multiple features under a hypercube structure. In our scheme, each feature of uncertain objects is represented as a component of the vertex's coordinate in hypercube. At the same time, we prefer to define the edges between vertices with relative entropy rather than Euclidean distance. Because the former one could accurately measures the difference between two probability distributions of data. We evaluate our proposed schemes with real data of a crowd sensing recognition case, which are collected by smartphones with sensors.},

Recent research in MCS highlights the following facts: 1) a utility metric can be defined for both the platform and the users, quantifying the value received by either side; 2) incentivizing the users to participate is a non-trivial challenge; 3) correctness and truthfulness of the acquired data must be verified, because the users might provide incorrect or inaccurate data, whether due to malicious intent or malfunctioning devices; and 4) an intricate relationship exists among platform utility, user utility, user reputation, and data trustworthiness, suggesting a co-quantification of these inter-related metrics. In this paper, we study two existing approaches that quantify crowd-sensed data trustworthiness, based on statistical and vote-based user reputation scores. We introduce a new metric - collaborative reputation scores - to expand this definition. Our simulation results show that collaborative reputation scores can provide an effective alternative to the previously proposed metrics and are able to extend crowd sensing to applications that are driven by a centralized as well as decentralized control.},

Then iCrowd, a generic MCS task allocation framework operating with the energy-efficient Piggyback Crowdsensing task model, is proposed to optimize the MCS task allocation with different incentives and k-depth coverage objectives/constraints. iCrowd first predicts the call and mobility of mobile users based on their historical records, then it selects a set of users in each sensing cycle for sensing task participation, so that the resulting solution achieves two dual optimal MCS data collection goals - i.e., Goal. 1 near-maximal k-depth coverage without exceeding a given incentive budget or Goal. 2 near-minimal incentive payment while meeting a predefined k -depth coverage goal. We evaluated iCrowd extensively using a large-scale real-world dataset for these two data collection goals. The results show that: for Goal.1, iCrowd significantly outperformed three baseline approaches by achieving 3-60 percent higher k-depth coverage; for Goal.2, iCrowd required 10.0-73.5 percent less incentives compared to three baselines under the same k-depth coverage constraint. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Sparse mobile crowdsensing applications intelligently select only a small portion of the target area for sensing while inferring the data of the remaining unsensed area with high accuracy. We discuss the fundamental research challenges in sparse mobile crowdsensing, and design a general framework with potential solutions to the challenges.

abstract = {In opportunistic mobile crowdsensing, data can be collected by leveraging human mobility and smartphones' sensors. In this paper, we propose Re-OPSEC, a framework for tasking effective providers from the crowd at real time in energy efficient way. Re-OPSEC piggybacks sensing tasks with volunteer-specific connectivity patterns called online episodes. That is those times when smartphones have a mobile broadband access, a high level of battery power and a volunteer activity adequate to the required detected sample. Tasks allocation is based on the expected opportunity to succeed the sensing task in the online episode underlying region, but without exhausting smartphones energy. Exhaustive experiments are conducted while adopting a realistic mobility data set extended with additional information simulation. The results demonstrate that timeliness of detected data and coverage rate are achieved in spite of energy saving mechanisms restriction.},

Cloud computing was expected to solve heavy computation problems, so researchers tried to connect it to mobile networks, but always hindered by the expensive nature of mobile access networks from money, power, delay and other viewpoints. In our previous work, we have proposed a mobile cloud architecture that succeeded in merging the two technologies into a homogeneous one by overcoming the expensive nature of access networks. In this work we are going to extend this architecture by proposing a unified Authentication and Key Agreement mechanism suitable for both mobile mutual authentication and cloud's authentication and Single-Sign-On.},

abstract = {With an increase in the number of mobile applications, the development of mobile crowdsensing systems has recently attracted a significant attention in both academic researchers and industries. In mobile crowdsensing system, the remote cloud (or back-end server) harvests all the crowdsensing data from the mobile devices, and the crowdsensing data can be uploaded immediately via 3G/4G. To reduce the cost and energy consumption, many academic researchers and industries investigate the way of mobile data offloading. Due to the sparse distribution of the WiFi APs, the crowdsensing data is often delayed to offloading. In this paper, compared with offloading data via WiFi APs, we investigate the communication and sharing of crowdsensing data by vehicles near the event (such as a pathole on the road), termed as a local crowd. The crowd-based approach has a lower delay than the offloading-based approach, by considering the quality of truth discovery. We define an utility function related to the crowdsensing data shared by the local crowd, in order to quantify the trade-off between the quality of the truth discovery and the user satisfaction. Our extensional simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Tinnitus, the phantom sensation of sound, is a highly prevalent disorder that is difficult to treat, i.e., Available treatments are only effective for patient subgroups. Sufficiently large and qualitative longitudinal data sets, which aggregate the individuals' demographic and clinical characteristics, together with their response to specific therapeutic interventions, would therefore facilitate evidence-based treatment suggestions for individual patients. Currently, clinical trials are the standard instrument for realizing evidence-based medicine. However, the related information gathering is limited. For example, clinical trials try to reduce the complexity of the individual case by generating homogeneous groups to obtain significant results. From the latter, individual treatment decisions are inferred. A complementary approach would be to assess the effect of specific interventions in large samples considering the individual peculiarity of each subject. This allows providing individualized treatment decisions. Recently, mobile crowd sensing emerged as an approach for collecting large and ecological valid datasets at rather low costs. By providing mobile crowd sensing services to large numbers of patients, large datasets can be gathered cheaply on a daily basis. In the Track Your Tinnitus project, we implemented a mobile crowd sensing platform to reveal new medical aspects on tinnitus and its treatment. Additionally, we work on mobile services exploring approaches for understanding tinnitus and for improving its diagnostic and therapeutic management. We present the Track Your Tinnitus platform as well as its goals, architecture and preliminary results. Overall, the platform and its mobile services offer promising perspectives for tinnitus research and treatment.},

As mobile devices are owned and controlled by individuals with various capabilities and intentions, a main challenge MCS applications face is to ensure the credibility of the crowd contributed data. Existed works attempt to increase confidence level of the sensory measurements by validating the location. However, the required infrastructure or neighbor support may not always be available, and the unreliable form containing false sensory data with a valid location is implicitly ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Crowd-based Credibility Improving Scheme (CCIS) to improve the credibility of data in possible false forms leveraging crowd data property and crowd participants' reputation. Based on the data clusters generated using a lightweight fixed-width clustering algorithm, CCIS is able to adequately identify and filter out the clusters constituted mainly by false data using reputation information as the classifier. We conduct simulations on a publicly available trace with crowd contributed temperature measurements, the results show that CCIS yields an improvement of overall data credibility of around 1.2 with clustering accuracy over 96{\%}.},

However, in the sense of coverage quality, marginal works have considered the efficient (less participants) and effective (more coverage) designs for mobile crowdsensing network. We investigate the optimal coverage problem in distributed crowdsensing networks. In that, the sensing quality and the information delivery are jointly considered. Different from the conventional coverage problem, ours only select a subset of mobile users, so as to maximize the crowdsensing coverage with limited budget. We formulate our concerns as an optimal crowdsensing coverage problem, and prove its NP-completeness. In tackling this difficulty, we also prove the submodular property in our problem. Leveraging the favorable property in submodular optimization, we present the greedy algorithm with approxima√ tion ratio O( √k), where k is the number of selected users. Such that the information delivery and sensing coverage ratio could be guaranteed. Finally, we make extensive evaluations for the proposed scheme, with trace-driven tests. Evaluation results show that the proposed scheme could outperform the random selection by 2× with a random walk model, and over 3× with real trace data, in terms of crowdsensing coverage. Besides, the proposed scheme achieves near optimal solution comparing with the bruteforce search results.},

In this paper, we consider a reward mechanism design for the service provider to achieve diversity in the collected data by exploiting the users' social relationship. Specifically, we formulate a two-stage decision problem, where the service provider first optimizes its rewards for profit maximization. The users then decide their effort levels through social network interactions as a participation game. The analysis is particularly challenging due to the users' interplay in both the diversity and social graphs, which leads to a non-convex bilevel optimization problem. Surprisingly, we find that the service provider can focus on one superimposed graph that incorporates the diversity and social relationship and compute the optimal reward as the Katz centrality in closed-form. Simulation results, based on the random graph and a real Facebook trace, show that the availability of network information improves both the service provider's profit and the users' social surplus over the incomplete information cases.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing emerges as a promising sensing paradigm through leveraging the diverse embedded sensors in massive mobile devices. A key objective in mobile crowdsensing is to efficiently schedule mobile device users to perform multiple sensing tasks. Prior work mainly focused on the interactions between the task layer and the user layer, without considering the similarity of tasks' data requirements and the heterogeneity of users'sensing capabilities. In this work, we propose a three-layer data-centric crowdsensing model by introducing a new data layer between tasks and users, which allows us to effectively leverage both the task similarity and the user heterogeneity. We formulate a joint task selection and user scheduling problem on top of the data layer, aiming at maximizing the social welfare. This problem is difficult to solve due to the combinatorial nature as well as the two-sided private information of tasks and users. To address both issues, we propose a two- sided randomized auction mechanism, which is computationally efficient, individually rational, and incentive compatible in expectation. Simulations show that (i) the proposed randomized auction can achieve 90{\%} of the maximum social welfare (benchmark), and (ii) the social welfare gain due to data reuse increases with the task similarity and reaches up to 1300{\%} in our simulations.},

Conventional methods heavily relied on cooperations among users to achieve balanced resource utilization in platform-centric view. In achieving fairly low communication and computational overhead, and maintaining good load balancing property among selfish users, we resort to the 'd-choice' method based on 'Ball and Bin' theory [1] for balancing with limited information, and proliferate the 'Proportional Allocation' [2] scheme for selfish load balancing. We combine the good properties in aforementioned schemes and propose 'Chance-Choice', a lightweight distributed load balancing scheme for selfish users with fast convergence property. We find that, even with limited information, the balancing performance could be improved significantly, under the rule of opportunistic offloading and selfish behavior. Extensive evaluations have been made to show that, 'Chance-Choice' outperforms several existing algorithms. Typically, comparing with 'Proportional Allocation' scheme [2], ours could decrease the load gap by 50{\%} to 80{\%}, and reduce the overhead complexity from O(n) to O(1) comparing with the 'Max-weight Best Response' algorithm [3], where n denotes the number of mobile users in crowdsourcing system.},

Survey from a number of countries showed that the average household expenditures had also increased, notably in the past two years. One way to alleviate the impact of the rise in goods prices is by being more selective in buying the items. Being selective means buying the items at the stores that offer the lowest prices. To do that, a mechanism to compare the prices of items between stores is needed, in which, the local pricewatch information solicitation and sharing (LoPrice) model was proposed. The challenge to the design of such model is in the choice of suitable approach for collecting the information on prices from different stores in a timely manner. In this paper, mobile crowdsourcing is proposed to be the approach that is able to address the challenge. Review on existing price comparison applications, including their advantages and disadvantages is also included.

The widely available mobile sensors are used in collecting information during a task processing. However, gathering information from a remote place, or an area of disaster, is not trivial, given the unavailability of appropriate infrastructure. Existing delay tolerant networking approaches address this issue but suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the lack of sufficient user participation.

Our proposed architecture combines crowdsourcing and the cellular network and forms a temporal delay tolerant cloud.

We provide a detailed reasoning of the security and feasibility of our model, and delineate probable approaches for solving the various security related aspects. The paper includes the design and implementation of a realistic-simulation model for D-CLOC. The simulation scenario incorporates an example face recognition task for evaluating the performance of our proposed model.

abstract = {Crowdsensing has become increasingly popular due to its ability to collect a massive amount of real-time data with the help of many individual smartphone users. A crowdsensing platform can utilize the collected data to extract effective information and provide services to service requesters. Due to the rationality of smartphone users, designing an incentive mechanism to compensate the participants for their resources consumption is critical in attracting more participation. Offline incentive mechanism design has been widely studied in various crowdsensing applications, whereas the online scenario, is much more challenging due to the unavailability of future information when the platform has to make user selection decisions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of online crowdsensing by considering a critical property that the values of users' contributions decrease as time goes by. The time- discounting property is common in inter-temporal choice scenarios but has not been carefully addressed in mechanism design perspective. To handle this problem, we propose a new method to select users based on a time-related threshold, and present a strategyproof framework where participants prefer to submit their true types, instead of manipulating the market by misreporting their private information. We prove that our mechanism can achieve computational efficiency, budget feasibility, strategy-proofness, and a constant competitive ratio. By comparing our mechanism with two heuristic benchmarks, we show that our design achieves great performance in terms of the total obtained value.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing applications can learn the aggregate statistics over personal data to produce useful knowledge about the world. Since personal data may be privacy-sensitive, the aggregator should only gain desired statistics without learning anything about the personal data. Differential privacy, the state-of-the-art privacy mechanism, can provide strong protection to ensure parties' privacy in such scenarios. Correspondingly, based on the differential privacy, many collusion-tolerant aggregation schemes have been proposed. However, those collusion-tolerant schemes usually incur high accumulated error and also require the priori knowledge of the fraction of those colluded parties. In this paper, we propose a differential-private collusion-tolerant aggregation protocol, while incurring no additionally error except the noise required for providing the differential privacy guarantee. Another salient characteristic of the proposed protocol is that it need not to have an priori estimation of those colluded parties. In addition, we also design an efficient aggregation encryption scheme to support those mobile crowdsensing applications where large plaintext is required. We also make some extensions to make the proposed protocol more applicable in realities, such as the fault tolerant. The analysis shows that the proposed protocol can achieve desired goals, and the performance evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency in reality.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of mobile phones and the increasing sensing capabilities of their built-in sensors have made mobile crowdsensing a promising approach for large-scale data collection. In mobile crowdsensing, a specific situation is that the service provider (SP) needs to recruit contributors to fulfill sensing tasks requested by consumers. There are several challenges for contributor selection and task allocation in mobile crowdsensing. Firstly, since some of the contributors may need to travel a certain distance to complete the sensing task, they may need to be compensated for their contributions, in proportion to the distance they need to travel. Secondly, the diversity in sensing devices and contributor behavior means that the sensing data from different contributors will have different Quality of Information (QoI). Moreover, the SP usually only has a limited budget to compensate the contributors. Thus, how to handle the trade-offs between traveling distances of the contributors and QoI of the sensing data in order to maximize the sensing revenue based on limited budget is an important consideration in mobile crowdsensing applications. In practice, the QoI from different contributors are usually unknown to the SP in advance, which makes contributor selection and task allocation even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a QoI-aware task allocation scheme (QOATA) for contributor selection and task allocation in mobile crowdsensing applications. Using an online learning approach to learn the QoI from different contributors, the scheme aims to achieve the highest sensing revenue under a limited budget. The effectiveness of QOATA is evaluated through extensive simulations.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is vulnerable to faked sensing attacks, as selfish smartphone users sometimes provide faked sensing results to the MCS server to save their sensing costs and avoid privacy leakage. In this paper, the interactions between an MCS server and a number of smartphone users are formulated as a Stackelberg game, in which the server as the leader first determines and broadcasts its payment policy for each sensing accuracy. Each user as a follower chooses the sensing effort and thus the sensing accuracy afterward to receive the payment based on the payment policy and the sensing accuracy estimated by the server. The Stackelberg equilibria of the secure MCS game are presented, disclosing conditions to motivate accurate sensing. Without knowing the smartphone sensing models in a dynamic version of the MCS game, an MCS system can apply deep Q-network (DQN), which is a deep reinforcement learning technique combining reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques, to derive the optimal MCS policy against faked sensing attacks. The DQN-based MCS system uses a deep convolutional neural network to accelerate the learning process with a high-dimensional state space and action set, and thus improve the MCS performance against selfish users. Simulation results show that the proposed MCS system stimulates high-quality sensing services and suppresses faked sensing attacks, compared with a Q-learning-based MCS system.},

Resource usage involves load-dependent costs and one resource may serve several requests at the same time. Due to human involvement and mobility there exists uncertainty, which we address by introducing certainty parameters. For the Nash equilibria of our game, we can transfer efficiency guarantees, i.e., the worst-case ratio between the welfare of an equilibrium and the welfare of a social optimum is provably bounded by a small constant when cost functions are polynomials. An epsilon-approximation of a Nash equilibrium solution can be computed in polynomial time for affine cost functions.

However, incen- tive mechanisms only provide adequate sensing opportunities on the condition that the available user base is large. If existing users are fewer than the required number of participants, incentive mechanisms will lose efficacy.

Within each sensing cycle, HySense combines mobile devices with static sensor nodes to generate uniformly dis- tributed space-time data under the constraint of field coverage. To balance sensing opportunities among different geographic regions, redundant users are efficiently migrated from densely popu- lated areas to sparsely populated areas. HySense utilizes calibration mode for checking whether the participants' behavior patterns are consistent with the sensing task queue.

Different mechanisms have been designed to incentivize mobile users to participate in crowdsensing. However, there are still many open issues needed to be investigated for these incentive mechanisms. In this paper, we systematically study the collusion resistance issue for incentive mechanisms in crowdsensing applications. For a typical type of mobile crowdsensing scenarios, we have two theoretical findings, i.e., the criteria to determine whether an incentive mechanism can inherently resist the collusions with and without profit trading respectively. These criteria have direct practical benefits in screening potential incentive mechanisms for mobile crowdsensing. Furthermore, we also propose our solution that can resist any form of collusion attacks, even including profit trading among the attackers.

In modern society, the rapid advances of mobile and communication technologies significantly enhance the applications and popularization of crowdsourcing. Most mobile devices today are equipped with powerful processors, various sensors, large memories, and fast wireless communication modules, etc. Due to the integration of these sophisticated components, mobile devices have become one kind of the important tools to sense, communicate, and compute data. For instance, smartphones can be used to collect video/image data (with cameras), acoustic data (with microphone), location information (with GPS), and other useful contextual information (with a gyroscope and accelerometers), etc. They can also transmit data via cellular networks, WiFi, and bluetooth, etc. According to the forecasts from Canalys, worldwide mobile device shipments, including notebooks, tablets, smart phones, etc., will exceed 2.6 billion units by 2016. Those powerful mobile devices not only make the crowdsourcing tasks easier to be taken by the crowd, but also enrich the diversity of crowdsourcing tasks. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

In this paper, we study incentive mechanisms for a novel Mobile Crowdsensing Scheduling (MCS) problem, where a mobile crowdsensing application owner announces a set of sensing tasks, then human users (carrying mobile devices) compete for the tasks based on their respective sensing costs and available time periods, and finally the owner schedules as well as pays the users to maximize its own sensing revenue under a certain budget. We prove that the MCS problem is NP-hard and propose polynomial-time approximation mechanisms for it. We also show that our approximation mechanisms (including both offline and online versions) achieve desirable game-theoretic properties, namely truthfulness and individual rationality, as well as O(1) performance ratios.

It is of paramount importance for mobile crowdsourcing to provide incentive mechanisms. State-of-the-art auction mechanisms for mobile crowdsourcing are deterministic in the sense that given the real costs of the smartphone users, a fixed set of smartphone users are recruited for performing sensing tasks. This leads to serious issues including reduced diversity of sensing devices and starvation of some users. In this paper, we propose an approximate-truthful randomized combinatorial auction mechanism for the social cost minimization problem, which is NP-hard. We design an approximate task allocation algorithm that is near optimal with polynomial-time complexity and use it as a block to construct the whole randomized auction mechanism. We carry out numerical studies and show that our randomized auction mechanism achieves approximate truthfulness, individual rationality, and high computation efficiency. Moreover, the proposed mechanism increases diversity of devices and prevents starvation of some smartphones.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has been intensively explored recently due to its flexible and pervasive sensing ability. Although many crowdsensing platforms have been built for various applications, the general issue of how to manage such systems intelligently remains largely open. While recent investigations mostly focus on incentivizing crowdsensing, the robustness of crowdsensing toward uncontrollable sensing quality, another important issue, has been widely neglected. Due to the nonprofessional personnel and devices, the quality of crowdsensing data cannot be fully guaranteed, hence the revenue gained from mobile crowdsensing is generally uncertain. Moreover, the need for compensating the sensing costs under a limited budget has exacerbated the situation: one does not enjoy an infinite horizon to learn the sensing ability of the crowd and hence to make decisions based on sufficient statistics. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Budget LImited robuSt crowdSensing (BLISS), to handle this problem through an online learning approach. Our approach aims to minimize the difference on average sense (a.k.a. regret) between the achieved total sensing revenue and the (unknown) optimal one, and our BLISS sensing policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, we use extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of BLISS.},

In this paper, we focus on the Deadline-sensitive User Recruitment (DUR) problem for probabilistically collaborative mobile crowdsensing. Unlike previous works, mobile users in this problem perform sensing tasks with probabilities, and multiple users might be recruited to cooperatively perform a common task, ensuring that the expected completion time is no larger than a deadline. Owing to such a probabilistic collaboration, DUR can be formalized as a non-trivial set cover problem with non-linear programming constraints and an optimization objective of real function. We first prove that the DUR problem is NP-hard. Then, we propose a greedy DUR algorithm, called gDUR, to solve this problem. Next, we prove that the gDUR algorithm can achieve a logarithmic approximation ratio. Furthermore, we extend the problem to a more complex case where sensing duration is taken into consideration, and we propose a sensing-duration-aware user recruitment algorithm, called dDUR. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed algorithms through extensive simulations, based on a real mobile social network trace and a synthetic trace.},

abstract = {—Mobile crowdsensing takes advantage of perva-sive mobile devices to collect and process data for a variety of applications (e.g., traffic monitoring, spectrum sensing). In this study, a socially-aware crowdsensing system is advocated, in which a cloud-based platform incentivizes mobile users to participate in sensing tasks by leveraging social trust among users, upon receiving sensing requests. For this system, social trust assisted reciprocity (STAR) -a synergistic marriage of social trust and reciprocity, is exploited to design an incentive mechanism that stimulates users' participation. Given the social trust structure among users, the efficacy of STAR for satisfying users' sensing requests is thoroughly investigated. Specifically, it is first shown that all requests can be satisfied if and only if sufficient social credit can be " transferred " from users who request more sensing service than they can provide to users who can provide more than they request. Then utility maximization for sensing services under STAR is investigated, and it is shown that it boils down to maximizing the utility of a circulation flow in the combined social graph and request graph. Accordingly, an algorithm that iteratively cancels a cycle of positive weight in the residual graph is developed, which computes the optimal solution efficiently, for both cases of divisible and indivisible sensing service. Extensive simulation results corroborate that STAR can significantly outperform the mechanisms using social trust only or reciprocity only.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the cyber, social and physical worlds are increasingly integrating and merging. Especially, combining the strengths of humans and machines helps tackle increasing hard tasks that neither can be done alone. Following this trend, this paper designs a Quality aware Truthful Incentive mechanism for cyber-physical enabled Geographic crowdsensing called Geo-QTI. Different from existing work, Geo-QTI appropriately accommodates the utilities of various stakeholders: requesters, participants and the crowdsourcing platform, and explicitly takes the requesters' quality requirements, and participants' quality provision into account. Geo-QTI explicitly includes four components: requester selection, participant selection, pricing and allocation. Requester selection with feasible analysis removes the requesters whose job cannot be completed by all participants or suffers from the monopoly participant (without the participant's contribution, others cannot cover requesters' requirement), obtains winning requesters set and determines actual payments. In participant selection phase, the platform aggregates the requested tasks (submitted by all winning requesters) in the sensed geographic area, and chooses the appropriate participants satisfying the winning requesters' quality requirements with total cost as low as possible. Pricing phase determines the payments to winning participants. The phase of allocation assigns the specific participants to minimally cover the quality requirements of those winning requesters. Rigid theoretical analysis demonstrates Geo-QTI can achieve both requesters' and participants' individual rationality and truthfulness, computational efficiency and budget balance for the platform. Furthermore, the extensive simulations confirm our theoretical analysis, and illustrate that Geo-QTI can reduce requesters' expenses greatly and ensure the fairness of allocation.},

abstract = {Abstract A number of information and resource sharing systems arise and become popular with the rapid development of communication technologies and mobile smart devices. The interactions between humans and machines are intense and their synergistic reactions have attracted special attention for the reason of forming so called Human-Machine Networks (HMN). HMNs refer to these networks where humans and machines work together to provide synergistic effects on their payoffs. Game theory, which can capture the interactions among players dexterously, has been widely used in solving various problems in HMN systems from the view of economics. In this paper, we extensively review the literature about game theoretical methods in HMNs, in particular focusing on its typical systems such as crowdsourcing, an elemental HMN and Internet of Things (IoT), a hybrid HMN, as well as Bitcoin. We propose a series of requirements to evaluate existing work. For reviewing and analyzing each system, we specify application purposes, players, strategies, game models and equilibriums based on our proposed requirements. In the sequel, we identify a number of common and distinct open issues in HMNs and point out future research directions.},

A number of research works have identified that mobile crowdsensing in vehicular social networks (VSNs) can be effectively used for many purposes and bring huge economic benefits, e.g., safety improvement and traffic management. This paper presents our effort that toward context-aware mobile crowdsensing in VSNs. First, we introduce a novel application-oriented service collaboration (ASCM) model which can automatically match multiple users with multiple mobile crowdsensing tasks in VSNs in an efficient manner. After that, for users' dynamic contexts of VSNs, we proposes a context information management model, that aims to enable the mobile crowdsensing applications to autonomously match appropriate service and information with different users (requesters and participants) in crowdsensing.},

abstract = {Participatory sensing can leverage a large amount of smartphone users to collect and analysis sensing data. Conducting sensing task consumes the resource of smartphone user. Therefore, in order to motivate selfish and rational smartphone users to participate in sensing task, incentive mechanism plays a key role in the success of this new sensing paradigm by providing appropriate compensation (e.g., payment or reward) to smartphone users. Most of previous works on the incentive mechanism design focus on the participation of mobile users, rather than the quality of sensing data. In this paper, we take the quality of sensing data into consideration, and design a reputation-aware incentive mechanism which can maximize the weighted social welfare of the whole system, guarantee the truthfulness and individual rationality. Simulation results show the better performance of the proposed incentive mechanism compared with three other counterparts in terms of weighted social welfare and average reputation. Specifically, the proposed mechanism can improve the weighted social welfare by 8.65{\%} and 48.16{\%} compared with TSCM and random selection, respectively, with the number of smartphone users N = 18.},

abstract = {Widespread use of connected smart devices that are equipped with various built-in sensors has introduced the mobile crowdsensing concept to the IoT-driven information and communication applications. Mobile crowdsensing requires implicit collaboration between the crowdsourcer/recruiter platforms and users. Additionally, users need to be incentivized by the crowdsensing platform because each party aims to maximize their utility. Due to the participatory nature of data collection, trustworthiness and truthfulness pose a grand challenge in crowdsensing systems in the presence of malicious users, who either aim to manipulate sensed data or collaborate unfaithfully with the motivation of maximizing their income. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach for trustworthiness-driven user recruitment in mobile crowdsensing systems that consists of three phases: i) user recruitment, ii) collaborative decision making on trust scores, and iii) badge rewarding. Our proposed framework incentivizes the users through a sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) and gamification techniques. Through simulations, we show that the platform and user utilities, defined in terms of costs and revenues, can be improved respectively by up to the order of 50{\%} and of at least 15{\%} when compared to fully-distributed and user-centric trustworthy crowdsensing.},

abstract = {Assessment of chronic disorders requires new ways of data collection compared to the traditional pen {\&} paper based approaches. For example, tinnitus, the phantom sensation of sound, is a highly prevalent disorder that is difficult to treat, i.e., available treatments are only effective for patient subgroups. In most individuals with tinnitus, loudness and annoyance of tinnitus varies over time. Currently, established assessment methods of tinnitus neither systematically assess this moment-to-moment variability nor environmental factors having an effect on tinnitus loudness and distress. However, information of individual fluctuations and the effect of environmental factors on the tinnitus might represent important information for tinnitus subtyping and for individualized treatment. In this context, a promising approach for collecting ecological valid longitudinal datasets at rather low costs is mobile crowdsensing. In the TrackYourTinnitus project, we developed an advanced mobile crowdsensing platform to reveal more detailed information about the course of tinnitus over time. In this paper, the patient mobile feedback service as a particular component of the platform is presented. It was developed to provide patients with aggregated information about the variation of their tinnitus over time. This mobile feedback service shall help a patient to demystify the tinnitus and to get better control of it, which should facilitate coping with this chronic health condition. As the basic principles and design of this mobile services are also applicable to other chronic disorders, promising perspectives for disorder management and clinical research arise.},

abstract = {Mobile Crowdsensing is an effective paradigm to perform tasks in many scenarios by utilizing crowd intelligence and sensing resources. However, the responses from users are often unreliable due to the low-paid rewards and their biased expertise of the crowd. In this paper, we propose a multi-class labeling scheme based on BCH codes (BCH-MCL) for the mobile crowdsensing system where the quality of crowd is unknown. For multi-class labeling tasks, BCH-MCL provides each label a BCH codeword with maximum error correction capability, and maps the responses of the crowd into an estimated codeword to determine the final estimated label. The theoretical analysis characterizes the fault-tolerance capability of BCH-MCL, and derives an upper bound of the mis-label probability for the proposed BCH-MCL scheme, with a necessary condition and a sufficient condition presented. Furthermore, we prove that BCH-MCL can achieve a more accurate estimation and much lower computational complexity, compared with prior work DCFECC. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BCH-MCL.},

However, in most of the existing work, the heterogeneity of MCSs has not been fully exploited. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we study the joint problem of sensing task assignment and scheduling while considering partial fulfillment, attribute diversity, and price diversity. We first elaborately model the problem as a reverse auction and design a distributed auction framework. Then, based on this framework, we propose two distributed auction schemes, cost-preferred auction scheme (CPAS) and time schedule-preferred auction scheme (TPAS), which differ on the methods of task scheduling, winner determination, and payment computation. We further rigorously prove that both CPAS and TPAS can achieve computational-efficiency, individual-rationality, budget-balance, and truthfulness. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of both CPAS and TPAS in terms of sensing task's allocation efficiency, mobile user's working time utilization and utility, and truthfulness.},

It extracts the position, size and orientation information of individual landmark objects from images taken by users. It also obtains the spatial relation between adjacent landmark objects from inertial sensor data, then computes the coordinates and orientations of these objects on an initial floor plan. By combining user mobility traces and locations where images are taken, it produces complete floor plans with hallway connectivity, room sizes and shapes. Our experiments on 3 stories of 2 large shopping malls show that the 90-percentile errors of positions and orientations of landmark objects are about 1 ∼ 2m and 5 ∼ 9◦, while the hallway connectivity is 100{\%} correct.},

Opportunistic real time mobile crowdsensing pertains to the instantaneous monitoring of large scale phenomena by leveraging human mobility and smartphones' sensors. However, while urban applications concern more about coverage quality and timeliness of detected data, mobile users should care about their consumed energy for performing a sensing task. In this paper, we introduce the Real time OPportunistic Scheduler Framework for Energy aware mobile Crowdsensing (Re-OPSEC). Especially, we present in deep the off-line tasks allocation approach operating on top of energy saving model. The methodology consists of two main processes. Re-OPSEC builds firstly connectivity patterns called online episodes and extracts mobility information jointly with those patterns. Secondly, it allocates, in an off-line mode, online episodes to send jointly sensing tasks in real time. Allocated patterns should increase the total expected sensing revenue and protect volunteers from embarassed situations such as their smartphones turning off. The performance of the approach is evaluated using realistic mobility datasets. The results demonstrate firstly the superiority of our approach as compared to an other existing work. Secondly, they prove that coverage rate can achieve a high level in spite of energy saving mechanisms restriction.},

Usually, in interviews or self-report questionnaires, patients are asked to report symptoms as well as their severity and duration retrospectively. However, only little is known to what degree such retrospective reports reflect the symptoms experienced in daily life some time ago. Mobile technologies can help to bridge this gap: mobile self-help services allow patients to record their symptoms prospectively when (or shortly after) they occur in daily life. In this study, we present results that we obtained with the mobile crowdsensing platform TrackYourTinnitus to show that there is a discrepancy between the prospective assessment of symptom variability and the retrospective report thereof. To be more precise, we evaluated the real-time entries provided to the platform by individuals experiencing tinnitus. The results indicate that mobile technologies like the TrackYourTinnitus crowdsensing platform may go beyond the role of an assistive service for patients by contributing to more accurate diagnosis and, hence, to a more elaborated treatment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.With the ubiquity of mobile appliances, efficient wireless access has become an urgent need for mobile users. Efficient wireless access requires accurate radio signal maps. Unfortunately, most of solutions could not be applied to large-scale urban space. Crowdsensing schemes could leverage the smartphone to sense WiFi signals, but could not provide accurate map because of the intolerable noises in mobile devices. Even worse, device heterogeneity makes the noise taming more intractable. Thus how to build accurate radio signal map with heterogeneous devices, especially in mobile crowdsensing is a major challenge. In this work, we build an accurate WiFi signal in geographical domain with iMap, a crowdsensing system leveraging heterogeneous smart devices to tame device noise ambiently in large-scale urban space. First of all, we deployed our system in typical urban area, and collect the real trace data with heterogeneous smart phones. After that, we make a synthetic analysis over the collected data, and find that, (1) although the noise is intolerable, it could be fitted to a statistical model fairly well, (2) although the noise model varies across smartphone types, the relative value between smart phones could be modeled. Leveraging this fundamental observation, we construct and implement an accurate RSS map with model-driven approach for taming heterogeneous noise, and geo-tagged measurements could be tamed for accurate RSS map. Experimental evaluations further validate our design.},

The purpose of this integration is dual. First, the embedded sensory capabilities of the resources provided by the crowd are combined with the sensing capabilities of the building for efficient smart actuations. Second, the system is able to interact with its users in a direct, personal way both for incentivising them to provide sensory data from their devices and to receive feed-back on their preferences and experienced comfort. The above are exposed to the experimenter as a set of services thus providing great agility on developing and evaluating a broad range of use case scenarios. We demonstrate this flexibility by deploying a testbed in the premises of a building and by evaluating several crowd incentive policies in the context of a smart luminance scenario. The scenario is based on Participatory Sensing principles to create live luminance maps, aggregate user preferences and accordingly adjust the luminance units.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of mobile devices coupled with the advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to the development of large-scale applications that can collect information about people and their environments in real-time. Such applications are referred to as Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). In MCS, tasks are allocated to participants (mobile devices) by a remote server according to the application requirements. The key challenge is reducing the energy consumption of the participating mobile devices. One of the effective approaches to reduce energy consumption of MCS applications is to improve efficiency of task allocation. An efficient task allocation approach can optimize several aspects of MCS applications such as task coverage (minimum number of participants required for a MCS task), data quality, and sensing costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Task Allocation (CATA) approach that aims to allocate sensing tasks to the best participant set while improving energy efficiency in MCS applications. Another important feature of the proposed CATA approach is that it preserves the privacy of participants' by only disclosing the less sensitive data to the server. The proposed approach employs local and global task allocation methods to enable two levels of data sharing and privacy. We describe the series of experiments that were conducted to validate our proposed approach in terms of coverage and efficiency.},

abstract = {Visual crowdsensing is successfully applied in numerous application areas, yet little work has been done on measuring and improving the quality of worker contributed visual data. Rather than evaluating the visual quality based on traditional metrics such as resolution, we focus on data diversity, which is crucial for a broad stream of visual crowdsensing tasks. Two representative diversity-oriented task types are studied, namely static object imagery and evolving event photography. The former aims to collect multi-facet/ aspect yet low redundant data about a stationary object, while the latter wants to detect and collect details of key scenes throughout an event. We link these quality needs with data utility and propose a unified visual crowdsensing framework called UtiPay. Data utility is characterized by the macro and micro diversity needs: at the macro level, the pyramid-tree approach is proposed for multi-attribute-based data grouping; at the micro level, we use several strategies for intra-group data selection and worker contribution measurement. To study the impact of our proposed utility measurement approaches, we propose two utility-enhanced payment schemes as incentive mechanisms: Uti and Uti-Bid. Experiments over several user studies with a total of 43 subjects validate the performance of UtiPay for measuring and enhancing the data quality of visual crowdsensing tasks.},

Mobile crowdsensing seems a promising solution for enabling the design/development and deployment of a wide range of advanced applications in various fields. In particular, public safety, transportation, and energy monitoring and management in urban environments can benefit from mobile crowdsensing in terms of advanced provisioned applications as well as savings of investments in the urban sensing infrastructure. However, enabling those advanced smart urban applications requires complex signal processing, machine learning, and resource management algorithms that are often beyond the skills of many mobile app developers. This paper describes the pivotal relevance of these facilities for mobile crowdsensing applications and presents our open-source solution, called Mobile Sensing Technology (MoST), for activity detection and geofencing, comparing it with the reference implementations provided by Google as part of the Google Play Services library. Experimental results within the testbed framework of a crowd-management application scenario validate MoST design guidelines and demonstrate the general-purpose, unintrusive, and power-efficient characteristics of MoST sensing capabilities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. WiFi networks are vulnerable to rogue AP attacks in which an attacker sets up an imposter AP to lure mobile users to connect. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, severely threatening users' privacy. Existing rogue AP detection solutions are confined to some specific attack scenarios (e.g., by relaying the traffic to a target AP) or require additional hardware. In this paper, we propose a crowdsensing based approach, named CRAD, to detect rogue APs in camouflage without specialized hardware requirement. CRAD exploits the spatial correlation of RSS to identify a potential imposter, which should be at a different location from the legitimate one. The RSS measurements collected from the crowd facilitate a robust profile and minimize the inaccuracy effect of a single RSS value. As a result, CRAD can filter out abnormal samples sensed in the realtime by dynamically matching the profile. We evaluate our approach with both a public dataset and a real prototype. The results show that CRAD can yield 90{\%} detection accuracy and precision with proper crowd presence, even when the rogue AP is launched close to the legitimate one (e.g., within 1m).},

Innovative methodologies and applications able to unlock such a huge potential are required. A domain where MCS really fits is mobility and transportation. However, for a full exploitation of this paradigm in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), distributed and self-management capabilities for the involved nodes-vehicles have to be provided. This paper is a first step in this direction, laying out an optimization system by exploiting feedback-driven patterns in a distributed-opportunistic way. In this sense, collective intelligence and stigmergic, swarm-based paradigms are adapted to an innovative decentralized MCS pattern toward new approaches in ITS. Their effectiveness is demonstrated through a traffic engineering case study, where route planning services are designed according to the proposed approach and then modeled and evaluated by Markovian agents.},

The communication performance of crowdsensing may deteriorate in some high-density areas due to the overwhelming communication requests, while the wireless bandwidth in other areas may not be fully utilized with sporadic and infrequent communication requests. Therefore, it is of great necessity to consider the imbalanced utilization of wireless resources in the design of a communication paradigm in mobile crowdsensing to meet the stringent QoS requirements.

Moreover, to improve flexibility and effectiveness, we consider fine-grained MCS, in which each sensing task is divided into multiple subtasks and a mobile user may make contributions to multiple subtasks. In this paper, we first introduce mathematical models for characterizing the quality of a recruited crowd for different sensing applications. Based on these models, we present a novel auction formulation for quality-aware and fine-grained MCS, which minimizes the expected expenditure subject to the quality requirement of each subtask. Then we discuss how to achieve the optimal expected expenditure, and present a practical incentive mechanism to solve the auction problem, which is shown to have the desirable properties of truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. We conducted trace-driven simulation using the mobility dataset of San Francisco taxies. Extensive simulation results show the proposed incentive mechanism achieves noticeable expenditure savings compared to two well-designed baseline methods, and moreover, it produces close-to-optimal solutions.},

Furthermore, to reduce the data quality loss caused by differential location obfuscation, we propose a privacypreserving framework with three components. First, we learn a data adjustment function to fit the original sensing data to the obfuscated location. Second, we apply a linear program to select an optimal location obfuscation function, which aims to minimize the uncertainty in data adjustment. We also propose a fast approximated variant. Third, we propose an uncertaintyaware inference algorithm to improve the inference accuracy of obfuscated data. Evaluations with real environment and traffic datasets show that our optimal method reduces the data quality loss by up to 42{\%} compared to existing differential privacy methods.},

The existence and awareness of the context provides the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around mobile device users. This allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. The key idea behind context-aware applications is to encourage users to collect, analyze and share local sensory knowledge in the purpose for a large scale community use by creating a smart network. The desired network is capable of making autonomous logical decisions to actuate environmental objects, and also assist individuals. However, many open challenges remain, which are mostly arisen due to the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory and bandwidth. Thus, it becomes critically important to study how the drawbacks can be elaborated and resolved, and at the same time better understand the opportunities for the research community to contribute to the context-awareness.

However, the crowd-sensed data are normally noise and unreliable due to the diverse mobility patterns and selfish behaviours of mobile users, making the classical data models in wireless sensor networks fail in this new context. In this paper, we propose a robust and reliable time series data model based on Dynamic Bayesian Network to describe the characteristics of the crowd-sensed data. The proposed data model can figure out the spatial and temporal correlation of data in the environment, where the data has high noise levels and mobile users are untrustworthy.

This is quite different from existing approaches, where each task initiator builds a specific mobile crowdsensing system and provides an incentive mechanism to maximize his/her own utility. We design distributed algorithms to compute the Walrasian equilibrium under the scenario where one cloud platform is available in the system. We propose to maximize social welfare of the whole system, and dual decomposition is then employed to divide the social welfare maximization problem into a set of sub-problems that can be solved by task initiators and mobile users. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution of social welfare maximization problem. Further, we show that the prices and task allocation obtained by the algorithm also yields a Walrasian equilibrium. Also, the proposed algorithm does not need the cloud to collect private information such as utility functions of task initiators and cost functions of mobile users.

In this article, we introduce a novel approach, called the social incentive mechanism, which, surprisingly, incentivizes the social friends of the participants who perform the sensing tasks. The basic idea is to leverage the social ties among participants to promote global cooperation. Since the incentive that a participant receives largely relies on the behaviors of his/her social friends, participants have the motivation to impact their friends' behaviors through their social relationships in order to gain a higher pay-off. This approach is applicable to many scenarios where the contributions to the quality of sensing among participants are interdependent, such as data aggregation. We have provided a case study which shows that the social incentive mechanism is more cost-effective than traditional incentive mechanisms.},

These "speaking objects" form the nodes of a dense distributed computing infrastructure that can be exploited to monitor and control activities in our everyday environment. However, the nature of speaking objects will dramatically change the approaches to implementing and coordinating the activities of distributed processes. In fact, distributed coordination is likely to become associated with the capability of argumenting about situations and about the current "state of the affairs", with the aim of triggering and directing proper distributed "conversations" to collectively reach a future desirable state. Accordingly, we discuss how such a novel vision can build upon some readily available technologies, and the research challenges that it poses. Two case studies are used as exemplary scenarios.},

In addition to MQTT, which is one of the commonly used publish/subscribe protocols in the context of IoT, there are a number of other message queuing solutions, either open or proprietary. We have designed a CloUd-based PUblish/Subscribe (CUPUS) middleware solution within the framework of the FP7 project OpenIoT1 that has developed an open-source cloud platform for the IoT. CUPUS is one of the core OpenIoT components which enables flexible integration of wearable sensors and mobile devices as data sources within the OpenIoT platform. In this paper we compare MQTT and CUPUS in the context of smart city application scenarios. Smart city services pose different key-requirements on IoT publish/subscribe solutions and thus we propose a taxonomy to identify vital features of IoT publish/subscribe middleware. The comparison shows that CUPUS is more appropriate for mobile environments with frequent context changes, while it can filter out unrequired data on devices prior to being reported to backend cloud servers. The MQTT protocol proves to be suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and heterogeneous environments due to its small code footprint, low bandwidth usage and standardized interfaces. Finally we evaluate the two solutions in terms of message footprint in a real-world scenario, latency and delivery semantics.},

abstract = {Mobile crime report services have become a pervasive approach to enabling community-based crime reporting (CBCR) in developing nations. These services hold the advantage of facilitating law enforcement when resource constraints make using standard crime investigation approaches challenging. However, CBCRs have failed to achieve widespread popularity in developing nations because of concerns for privacy. Users are hesitant to make crime reports with out strong guarantees of privacy preservation. Furthermore, oftentimes lack of data mining expertise within the law enforcement agencies implies that the reported data needs to be processed manually which is a time-consuming process. In this paper we make two contributions to facilitate effective and efficient CBCR and crime data mining as well as to address the user privacy concern. The first is a practical framework for mobile CBCR and the second, is a hybrid k-anonymity algorithm to guarantee privacy preservation of the reported crime data. We use a hierarchy-based generalization algorithm to classify the data to minimize information loss by optimizing the nodal degree of the classification tree. Results from our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrate that in addition to guaranteeing privacy, our proposed scheme offers a classification accuracy of about 38{\%} and a drop in information loss of nearly 50{\%} over previous schemes when compared on various sizes of datasets. Performance-wise we observe an average improvement of about 50ms proportionate to the size of the dataset. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {—We look into the realization of mobile crowdsensing campaigns that draw on the opportunistic networking paradigm, as practised in delay-tolerant networks but also in the emerging device-to-device communication mode in cellular networks. In particular, we ask how mobile users can be optimally selected in order to generate the required space-time paths across the network for collecting data from a set of fixed locations. The users hold different roles in these paths, from collecting data with their sensing-enabled devices to relaying them across the network and uploading them to data collection points with Internet connectivity. We first consider scenarios with deterministic node mobility and formulate the selection of users as a minimum-cost set cover problem with a submodular objective function. We then generalize to more realistic settings with uncertainty about the user mobility. A methodology is devised for translating the statistics of individual user mobility to statistics of space-time path formation and feeding them to the set cover problem formulation. We describe practical greedy heuristics for the resulting NP-hard problems and compute their approximation ratios. Our experimentation with real mobility datasets (a) illustrates the multiple tradeoffs between the campaign cost and duration, the bound on the hopcount of space-time paths, and the number of collection points; and (b) provides evidence that in realistic problem instances the heuristics perform much better than what their pessimistic worst-case bounds suggest.},

In this paper, we present a novel deep learning based indoor fingerprinting system using Channel State Information (CSI), which is termed DeepFi. Based on three hypotheses on CSI, the DeepFi system architecture includes an off-line training phase and an on-line localization phase. In the off-line training phase, deep learning is utilized to train all the weights of a deep network as fingerprints. Moreover, a greedy learning algorithm is used to train the weights layer-by-layer to reduce complexity. In the on-line localization phase, we use a probabilistic method based on the radial basis function to obtain the estimated location. Experimental results are presented to confirm that DeepFi can effectively reduce location error compared with three existing methods in two representative indoor environments.},

In this work we provide a novel capacity planning solution for hierarchical edge cloud that considers QoS requirements in terms of response delay, and diverse demands for CPU, GPU and network resources. Our solution improves edge utilization by combining complementary resource demands while satisfying QoS requirements.

Auction has been widely used to design mechanisms to stimulate smartphone users to participate in the crowdsensing applications and systems. Many auction-based incentive mechanisms have been proposed for crowdsensing. However, none of them has taken into consideration both the bid privacy of smartphone users and the social cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the design of privacy-preserving incentive mechanisms that also achieve approximate social cost minimization. In this paper, we design BidGuard, a general privacy-preserving frame-work for incentivizing crowdsensing. This framework works with different score functions for selecting users. In particular, we propose two score functions, linear and log functions, to realize the framework. We rigorously prove that BidGuard achieves computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, dif-ferential privacy and approximate social cost minimization. In addition, the BidGuard with log score function is asymptotically optimal in terms of the social cost. Extensive simulations evaluate the performance and validate the desired properties of BidGuard.},

Mobile crowdsensing (MCS), where casual smartphone users conduct the site survey, has recently emerged as a promising solution. Applying MCS to a system introduces new challenges: motivating active participation, inferring location information of unlabeled fingerprints, and managing a large amount of fingerprints. The proposed MCS framework obtains fingerprints from users by exploiting social network service applications and using the pedestrian dead reckoning technique. MCS accurately infers the location information of unlabeled fingerprints using physical-layout and signal-strength measurements. The framework also selects an optimal set of fingerprints, which introduces high accuracy with a slightly increased database size.

abstract = {Location information is a key element of participatory sensing. Many mobile and sensing applications require location information to provide better recommendations, object search and trip planning. However, continuous GPS positioning consumes much energy, which may drain the battery of mobile devices quickly. Although WiFi and cell tower positioning are alternatives, they provide lower accuracy compared to GPS. This paper solves the above problem by proposing a novel localization scheme through the collaboration of multiple mobile devices to reduce energy consumption and provide accurate positioning. Under our scheme, the mobile devices are divided into three groups, namely the broadcaster group, the location information receiver group and the normal participant group. Only the broadcaster group and the normal participant group use their GPS. The location information receiver group, on the other hand, makes use of the locations broadcast by the broadcaster group to estimate their locations. We formulate the broadcaster set selection problem and propose two novel algorithms to minimize the energy consumption in collaborative localization. Simulations with real traces show that our proposed solution can save up to 68{\%} of the energy of all of the participants and provide more accurate locations than WiFi and cellular network positioning.},

A critical problem in improving the QoS of crowdsensing is to decide which users to select to perform sensing tasks, in order to obtain the most informative data, while maintaining the total sensing costs below a given budget. The key challenges lie in (i) finding an effective measure of the informativeness of users' data, (ii) learning users' sensing costs which are unknown a priori, and (iii) designing efficient user selection algorithms that achieve low-regret guarantees. In this paper, we build Gaussian Processes (G-Ps) to model spatial locations, and provide a mutual information-based criteria to characterize users' informativeness. To tackle the second and third challenges, we model the problem as a budgeted multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem based on stochastic assumptions, and propose an algorithm with theoretically proven low-regret guarantee. Our theoretical analysis and evaluation results both demonstrate that our algorithm can efficiently select most informative users under stringent constraints.},

abstract = {Location data collection at a societal scale is increasingly becoming common - examples of this are call and data detail records in telecommunication companies, GPS samples collected by car companies, and GPS samples from mobile devices in mapping companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft). Such large scale mobility datasets have applications in urban planning, network planning, surveillance, and real-time traffic estimations. This paper addresses the problem of subsampling location traces while preserving the amount of information present in such datasets. We present a novel subsampling technique that is based on a hierarchical geographical encoding mechanism (geohash), that allows for efficient spatial cluster sampling. We analyze this subsampling technique through various information theoretic measures to quantify the total 'amount' of information in a dataset from a location trace perspective and evaluate these metrics in the context of two large scale mobility datasets from telecommunication companies - one is that of call detail records and the second is that of data detail records. We show that subsampling data in both these cases by as much as 75{\%} does not significantly reduce the total amount of information, i.e. the dataset can be used similar to the original version. This paves way for the creation of better space and CPU efficient models that can support various applications reliant on collective location traces. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

We experimentally show that mobile data mining provides an efficient and scalable approach for data collection for mobile crowdsensing. Our approach results in reducing the amount of data sent, as well as the energy usage on the mobile phone, while providing comparable levels of accuracy to traditional models of intermittent/continuous sensing and sending. We have implemented our Context-Aware Real-time Open Mobile Miner (CAROMM) to facilitate data collection from mobile users for crowdsensing applications. CAROMM also collects and correlates this real-time sensory information with social media data from both Twitter and Facebook. CAROMM supports delivering real-time information to mobile users for queries that pertain to specific locations of interest. We have evaluated our framework by collecting real-time data over a period of days from mobile users and experimentally demonstrated that mobile data mining is an effective and efficient strategy for mobile crowdsensing.},

abstract = {There has been a proliferation of public Wi-Fi hotspots that serve a significant amount of global mobile traffic today. In this paper, we propose a general Wi-Fi monetization model for public Wi-Fi hotspots deployed by venue owners (VOs), where VOs generate revenue from providing both the premium Wi-Fi access and the advertising sponsored Wi-Fi access to mobile users (MUs). With the premium access, MUs directly pay VOs for their Wi-Fi usage; while with the advertising sponsored access, MUs watch advertisements for the free usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces to advertisers (ADs) via an ad platform, and share a proportion of the revenue with the ad platform. We formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs, MUs, and ADs as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By analyzing the equilibrium, we show that the ad platform's advertising revenue sharing policy affects a VO's Wi-Fi price but not the VO's advertising price. Moreover, we prove that a single term called equilibrium indicator determines whether a VO will fully rely on the premium access, or fully rely on the advertising sponsored access, or obtain revenue from both types of access. Numerical results show that the VO obtains a large revenue under a large advertising concentration level and a medium MU visiting frequency.},

In this paper, the metric of data quality is introduced to measure the value of user to the tasks, based on which a social welfare maximization problem is formulated and a novel incentive mechanism through reverse auction is proposed. Specifically, The crowdsourcer considers user bidding profiles and their sensing quality together, and the quality requirements of tasks are used as constraints to ensure better sensing performance. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the proposed mechanism is proved to be computational efficient, individual rational and truthful. Meanwhile, the approximate optimal solution within a constant factor is achieved. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. {\&}copy; 2016 IEEE.},

The design of data collection is challenging due to the fact that smart devices have limited resources to conduct complex computation and sensing tasks in mobile opportunistic networks. In this paper, we propose a time-sensitive incentive-aware mechanism for mobile opportunistic crowdsensing data collection, in which each sensing data has an attached time-sensitive value that decays over time. We focus on the cooperative data collection problem in mobile opportunistic crowdsensing, where data collectors cooperate with mobile users to send data back to requesters. However, due to the selfishness of mobile users, we use an incentive mechanism to stimulate the mobile users to participate in the data collection. The objective is to maximize data collectors' and mobile relay users' rewards. We formulate the interaction among data carrier and mobile relay users as a two-user cooperative game, we apply the asymmetric Nash bargain solution to obtain the optimal cooperation decision and transfer payment. Extensive simulation results based on the real-world traces are provided to validate the  superiority of our proposed schemes.},

Secondly, we enrich the data based on a novel contextual awareness data interlinking. Finally, we refine recommendations with contexts, through taking into consideration meta-information interlinked to the main information of interest.

This method uses data from an accelerometer, a gyrometer, and an air pressure sensor, and does not require detailed information on the building structure. In activity sensing using wearable sensors, higher accuracy can be expected from detection of zones in which there is continuously little change in the states of the sensor signals than from detection of zones in which there are large changes in the sensor signals within a short time. We focus on such stability of sensing signal and, as an application example, we used the concept to estimate walking direction on the basis of stable walking zone detection using a gyrometer and estimation of movement between the floors of a building by detection of stable floor zones with an air pressure sensor. We then integrated these estimations to obtain a 3-D pedestrian trajectory. The results of evaluation experiments using an indoor pedestrian sensing corpus (HASC-IPSC) showed that this method achieved higher accuracy for both walking direction and movement between floors than was achieved by a method based on large changes in the sensor signals. We also confirmed that the cumulative error rate for estimation of the 3-D pedestrian trajectory was 1 m per 10 seconds of movement.},

However, traditional server-client mobile crowdsensing models suffer from a high operational cost on the server, and hence a poor scalability. Peer-to- peer (P2P) mobile crowdsensing models can effectively reduce the server's operational cost, by leveraging the mobile devices' under-utilized computation and storage resources. In a P2P mobile crowdsensing model, the sensing data is saved and processed in mobile users' devices in a distributed fashion, and is shared among mobile users directly in a P2P manner. In this work, we focus on the incentive issue in such a P2P mobile crowdsensing model. Specifically, we propose a data market and a generic pricing scheme for the data sharing among data sensors and requesters. We analyze the user interactions in such a data market from a game theoretic perspective, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium. We further propose a generalized best response dynamics to reach the market equilibrium. Our theoretic analysis and numerical results indicate that the equilibrium social welfare decreases with the data transfer cost and data prices, while the ratio of the equilibrium social welfare to the maximum social welfare benchmark increases with the data transfer cost and data prices.},

Besides exploring specific energy-efficient schemes pertaining to each aspect, this paper offers a perspective for research and applications. In brief, through classifying, summarizing and optimizing the multiple efforts on studying, modeling and reducing energy consumption for ProSe on mobile devices, the paper would provide guide for developers to build energy-efficient ProSe.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancements of mobile computing, mobile location recognition is becoming an important and useful service, which recognizes the logical locations of places/scenes that users are interested in, instead of physical coordinates. Most of the existing mobile location recognition systems utilize the image as visual fingerprint of a place, and need to construct a large-scale visual fingerprint database in advance. However, collecting visual fingerprints is a labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel crowdsourcing-based framework, and leverage a variety of sensors embedded in smartphones to collect richer location fingerprints for exploring their positive effects. To achieve higher recognition accuracy, we propose an object-centric fingerprint searching which can sufficiently take advantage of smartphone sensors and determine more accurate searching space than the traditional user-centric method. We build a crowdsourcing-based database with richer fingerprints and implement a location recognition system, called CrowdLR. Extensive experiments verify that our object-centric method can achieve promising results maintaining around 10{\%} precision higher than the user-centric method.},

abstract = {Increasingly over the last decade, there has been attention and expectations on the role that ICT solutions can play in increasing accountability, participation and transparency in the Public Administration. Also, attention to citizen participation is more and more at the center of the debate about Smart Cities. However technological solutions have been often proposed without considering first citizens needs and the sociotechnical misalignment within the city, i.e. in peripheral area. The paper outlines the design and implementation process of a wegovernment IT tool, called MiraMap. The project has been developed in the Mirafiori District in Torino (Italy), a neighbourhood which is characterized by problems of marginality and by several undergoing urban transformations with a very high potential for social and economic development in the next few years. This makes Mirafiori Sud a valuable case study environment to experiment new methods and IT solutions to strengthen connection between citizens and public administration. The object of MiraMap, indeed, is to facilitate communication and management between citizens and administration in reporting of issues and claims but also in submitting proposals. Collecting and handling this information in an efficient way is crucial to improve the quality of life in urban suburbs, addressing more targeted and better performed public policies. In order to achieve those results, the authors combined First Life, a new local social network based on an interactive map - with a Business Process Management (BPM) system for easing reports about claims and proposals to be handled. The research process involves an interdisciplinary team, composed by architects, computer scientists, engineers, geographers, legal experts, with the direct participation of local administrators and citizens.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) providing efficient road-transportation strategies have recently become a very active research area. Efficient transportation of visitors to/from highly congested sites is one of the most important challenges addressed by ITS. A transportation-system analysis is presented here and is applied on an urban city ring road network that encompasses a major attraction site characterized by correlated network-intersections and large vehicle-pedestrian movement conflicts. The presented model analysis first examines the influences exerted by network-correlations at intersection-points, and second, presents case-study evacuation scenarios examined under varying circumstances and flow-requirements within each segment of the modeled network. The significance of this paper is clearly evident in emergency/evacuation scenarios or in design considerations in which the influence of correlated network-intersections must be known beforehand. As a main contribution, a mathematical model was developed with simulations evaluating the current system using real-life data as statistical input to our model. Results had demonstrated the counter-propagation effect between adjacent intersections along the ring road of an urban congested city. Furthermore, the study modeled and investigated two emergency-evacuation scenarios within chosen segments at road network sites entering and exiting the central area in order to demonstrate how efficient evacuation can be conducted during an emergency scenario. It is expected that the results of this model can also be extended and applied for evacuation analyses for other sites with similar practical conditions or in other congested cities in which correlated intersections have a significant presence that must be included in the real-life analysis of a transportation system.},

abstract = {—One of the most important characteristics of the traditional approaches of searching a missing object is a soci-etal and infrastructural participatory crowd sensing where the crowds/participants 'consciously' opt to register the information in mind, and decide when, where, what, and how to sense and report. While the alert may extend to a broad community, the effectiveness of the crowd sensing doesn't reach its potential, due to its active participation factor in sensing, reporting, and processing methods. Unless there are clear incentives and privacy protection methods for the crowd sensors, it is considered very hard to achieve its practical deployment in reality. In this paper, we propose to automate the crowd sensing process and radically improve the effectiveness in the IoT System through opportunistic crowd sensing (OCS). Sensing a missing object's presence in proximity is automatically conducted by smartphones, as the application runs in the background and opportunistically collects and reports the data without active in-volvement of the user. We address the major technical challenges of privacy, security, sensing effectiveness, and user resource utilization, and validate its operation and effectiveness with the prototype system.},

Challenges arise with respect to collecting and managing sensor data in an energy- and bandwidth-efficient manner. In this paper we present a cloud-based system architecture centred around a publish/subscribe middleware interfaced with a quality-driven sensor management function, applicable for building mobile IoT applications. The architecture is designed so as to smartly manage and acquire sensor readings in order to satisfy global sensing coverage requirements, while obviating redundant sensor activity and consequently reducing overall system energy consumption. We evaluate the system using a proposed model for calculating bandwidth and energy savings. Model evaluation based on simulation results provides insight into the energy savings for different application requirements and geographical sensor distribution scenarios. Our results show that in certain identified cases, significant energy consumption reductions can be achieved utilizing the proposed architecture and sensor management scheme (as compared to a standard publish/subscribe approach), while maintaining overall global sensing quality level (in terms of required sensing coverage). Assumptions with regards to user distributions in urban areas are verified using an existing dataset reported in literature.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the internet and popularization of intelligent mobile devices, social media is evolving fast and contains rich spatial information, such as geolocated posts, tweets, photos, video, and audio. Those location-based social media data have offered new opportunities for hazards and disaster identification or tracking, recommendations for locations, friends or tags, pay-per-click advertising, etc. Meanwhile, a massive amount of remote sensing (RS) data can be easily acquired in both high temporal and spatial resolution with a multiple satellite system, if RS maps can be provided, to possibly enable the monitoring of our location-based living environments with some devices like charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras but on a much larger scale. To generate the classification maps, usually, labeled RS image pixels should be provided by RS experts to train a classification system. Traditionally, labeled samples are obtained according to ground surveys, image photo interpretation or a combination of the aforementioned strategies. All the strategies should be taken care of by domain experts, in a means which is costly, time consuming, and sometimes of a low quality due to reasons such as photo interpretation based on RS images only. These practices and constraints make it more challenging to classify land-cover RS images using big RS data. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to classify urban RS images by exploiting the semantics of location-based social media photos (SMPs). To validate the effectiveness of this methodology, an automatic classification system is developed based on RS images as well as SMPs via big data analysis techniques including active learning, crowdsourcing, shallow machine learning, and deep learning. As the labels of RS training data are given by ordinary people with a crowdsourcing technique, the developed system is named Crowd4RS. The quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed Crowd4RS system as well as the proposed methodology for automatically generating RS image maps in terms of classification results based on big RS data made up of multispectral RS images in a high spatial resolution and a large amount of photos from social media sites, such as Flickr and Panoramio.

On the contrary, we focus on a more realistic scenario where users arrive one by one online in a random order. Based on the online auction model, we investigate the problem that users submit their private types to the crowdsourcer when arrive, and the crowdsourcer aims at selecting a subset of users before a specified deadline for maximizing the value of services (assumed to be a non-negative monotone submodular function) provided by selected users under a budget constraint. We design two online mechanisms, OMZ and OMG, satisfying the computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget feasibility, truthfulness, consumer sovereignty and constant competitiveness under the zero arrival-departure interval case and a more general case, respectively.

DeepOpp can measure signal characteristics (strength, bandwidth and latency) and based on current and historical information make signal coverage predictions in order to activate data prefetching of social media content.

However, since high-mobility usually causes communication disconnections and the high re-transmission rate will consume more network resources, quality of experience (QoE) monitoring and control is a must that WMSNs with mobile sinks (MS-WMSNs) should provide satisfactory services with constrained resources. In this paper, we propose a novel QoE-named content-centric network paradigm for MS-WMSNs, which supports location independent networking and low redundancy data aggregation. Each network node constructs a hierarchical content naming tree (HCNT) negotiated by QoE parameters. The MS prioritizes the sensing data and caches them differentially by identifying these QoE parameters based content names. Simultaneously, to verify the feasibility, we design a stochastic network calculus model to analyse the performances of our proposed network paradigm at worst-case situation. Simulation results show that the proposed paradigm reduces end-to-end communication delay.},

abstract = {Smartphones are equipped with numerous sensors and have become sophisticated sensing platforms. However, several sensing applications running on a smartphone can degrade the device performance. This can be overcome by using lightweight application protocols which improve the smartphone performance in terms of bandwidth consumption, battery lifetime and communication latency. This work focuses on two emerging application protocols: the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Although both protocols have been designed for highly constrained environments such as sensors, they are also appropriate to be adopted in smartphone applications. We provide a qualitative and quantitative comparison between MQTT and CoAP when used as smartphone application protocols and we give preliminary indications on the application scenarios in which either protocol should be adopted. While MQTT has already been adopted in smartphone applications, CoAP is relatively new and has up to now mainly been considered for sensors and actuators. Our comparison shows that CoAP can be a valid alternative to MQTT for certain application scenarios.},

abstract = {In CSMA/CN, whenever inferring that a receiving frame gets corrupted, the receiver sends back its signature as a collision notification (CN) to the sender. Upon detecting an arrival of the CN, the sender will abort the ongoing transmission immediately. However, in low signal-to-interference-plus -noise ratio (SINR), the false alarm of the CN occurs frequently, which might force a sender not to transmit any frame at all. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes CSMA/ CN+ to enhance the performance of CSMA/ CN. In CSMA/CN+, we introduce an additional signature. The receiver, adapting to channel conditions and self-signal suppression capability, prudently determines whether to send back zero, one, or two signatures to the sender. In this way, we can reduce or exclude false alarms and therefore improve the system performance. In this paper, we first present the design of CSMA/CN+. We then apply the design in a wireless LAN, and theoretically analyze the detection performance of the notification and the system throughput. Extensive simulations verify that CSMA/CN+ can remarkably improve the system throughput of CSMA/CN and our analysis is very accurate.},

In crowdsensing, the optimal task allocation is challenging since sensing tasks with different requirements of quality of sensing are typically associated with specific locations and mobile users have time constraints. We show that the allocation problem is NP-hard. We then focus on approximation algorithms, and devise an efficient local ratio based algorithm (LRBA). Our analysis shows that the approximation ratio of the aggregate rewards obtained by the optimal allocation to those by LRBA is 5. This reveals that LRBA is efficient, since a lower (but not tight) bound on the approximation ratio is 4. We extend the results to the general scenario where mobile users are heterogeneous. A distributed version of LRBA, DLRBA, is designed, which can be executed iteratively at each mobile user without the need for the platform to collect all the information of mobile users. We prove that both centralized and distributed versions can output the same solution. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed schemes.},

In particular, their spectrum of sensing capabilities, together with consolidated diffusion and ease of use contribute to an increasing adoption in different mobility-based sensing scenarios. On the other hand, the availability of massive volumes of geospatial data provided by large-scale distributed sensing systems prompts the need for innovative approaches to efficient data gathering and processing. Data reduction strategies are often necessary in order to cope with challenges posed by these volumes, for instance when dealing with real-time visualization of query results. In this paper we present a data reduction and aggregation approach for mitigating the impact of data size in a vehicular sensing application aimed at monitoring the roughness of road surfaces. Data collected by smartphones on board of vehicles is progressively thinned at different levels of the proposed architecture through sampling and spatial/temporal aggregation. Preliminary results show that the proposed methodology provides substantial benefits in terms of reduced impact of data while, at the same time, it enables full exploitation of statistical error compensation.},

abstract = {Smart city sensing calls for crowdsensing via mobile devices that are equipped with various built-in sensors. As incentivizing users to participate in distributed sensing is still an open research issue, the trustworthiness of crowdsensed data is expected to be a grand challenge if this cloud-inspired recruitment of sensing services is to be adopted. Recent research proposes reputation-based user recruitment models for crowdsensing; however, there is no standard way of identifying adversaries in smart city crowdsensing. This paper adopts previously proposed vote-based approaches, and presents a thorough performance study of vote-based trustworthiness with trusted entities that are basically a subset of the participating smartphone users. Those entities are called trustworthy anchors of the crowdsensing system. Thus, an anchor user is fully trustworthy and is fully capable of voting for the trustworthiness of other users, who participate in sensing of the same set of phenomena. Besides the anchors, the reputations of regular users are determined based on vote-based (distributed) reputation. We present a detailed performance study of the anchor-based trustworthiness assurance in smart city crowdsensing through simulations, and compare it with the purely vote-based trustworthiness approach without anchors, and a reputation-unaware crowdsensing approach, where user reputations are discarded. Through simulation findings, we aim at providing specifications regarding the impact of anchor and adversary populations on crowdsensing and user utilities under various environmental settings. We show that significant improvement can be achieved in terms of usefulness and trustworthiness of the crowdsensed data if the size of the anchor population is set properly.},

Research has shown that listening to the right kind of music in these situations can ameliorate driver performance and improve road safety. Context-aware music delivery systems succeed in delivering suitable music according to the situation through the process of music mood-mapping which identifies the mood of a song. Additionally, we can leverage the power of the cloud to enable crowd sensing of the mood-mapping of various songs and enhance the effectiveness of situation-aware music delivery for drivers. The cloud can be used to aggregate the crowd sensed music mood-mapping data and improve the effectiveness of music delivery by providing accurate mood-mappings from the aggregated data. Currently, context-aware music delivery systems consider only features from the song for music mood-mapping.

abstract = {The use of sensor-enabled smart phones is considered to be a promising solution to large-scale urban data collection. In current approaches to mobile phone sensing systems (MPSS), phones directly transmit their sensor readings through cellular radios to the server. However, this simple solution suffers from not only significant costs in terms of energy and mobile data usage, but also produces heavy traffic loads on bandwidth-limited cellular networks. To address this issue, this paper investigates cost-effective data collection solutions for MPSS using hybrid cellular and opportunistic short-range communications. We first develop an adaptive and distribute algorithm OptMPSS to maximize phone user financial rewards accounting for their costs across the MPSS. To incentivize phone users to participate, while not subverting the behavior of OptMPSS, we then propose BMT, the first algorithm that merges stochastic Lyapunov optimization with mechanism design theory. We show that our proven incentive compatible approaches achieve an asymptotically optimal gross profit for all phone users. Experiments with Android phones and trace-driven simulations verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our approach manages to improve the system performance significantly (around 100{\%}) while confirming that our system achieves incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and server profitability.},

This kind of data collection can analyze the sensing data of users statistically without precise information about other users' sensing results. However, traditional randomized response schemes and their extensions require a large number of samples to achieve proper estimation.

Using only available equipment, it can provide dynamic navigation service to drivers. The proposed system consists of three main components: local traffic estimation, global traffic aggregation, and navigation. In this system, vehicles estimate local traffic state using vehicular contextual information including speed and acceleration by relying on fuzzy logic, and transmit the information to the urban server. The server integrates the received local traffic information from different vehicles and estimates the global traffic state, providing the traffic-aware navigation system to drivers. CANS performance is evaluated for an urban scenario in a traffic flow in Birjand, Iran. The experiment is conducted for evaluating CANS in both traffic congestion estimation and navigation.

abstract = {Crowdsourcing offers a cost-effective approach to distributed problem solving and data collection by soliciting contributions (solutions, ideas, data, etc.) from a large group of people. Recently, due to the burgeoning smartphone industry and the surging demand for sensing data, a new mobile computing and sensing paradigm called mobile crowdsensing has emerged and has created significant momentum in both industry and academia. Pivotal to the viability of all such crowdsourcing systems, is whether there is enough incentive to attract sufficient participation. Many crowdsourcing scenarios are heterogeneous in the sense that, not only the workers types (e.g., abilities and costs) are different, but the beliefs (probabilistic knowledge) about their respective types are also different. In this talk, we design an incentive mechanism for such scenarios using an asymmetric all-pay contest (or auction) model. Our design objective is an optimal mechanism, i.e., one that maximizes the crowdsourcing revenue minus cost. To achieve this, we furnish the contest with a prize tuple which is an array of reward functions for each potential winner (worker). We prove and characterize the unique equilibrium of this contest, and solve the optimal prize tuple. In addition, this study discovers a counter-intuitive property, strategy autonomy (SA), which means that heterogeneous workers behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. In the second part of the talk, we propose the use of Tullock contests as an alternative framework to design incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing. We explore a new dimension of optimal Tullock contents design by provisioning the prize as a function. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to attracting user entry in other domains. In this talk, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by superseding the contest prize-which is fixed in conventional Tullock contests-with a prize function that i- dependent on the (unknown) winners contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcers utility. We show that this approach leads to several attractive practical advantages.},

In our stochastic optimization, user activities are required to be synchronized with a backend under a cellular data limit to avoid overcharges from cellular operators. The mobile device is charged intermittently using wireless or wired charging for receiving the required energy for transmission and sensing operations. First, we propose an activity tracking policy by formulating a stochastic optimization as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Second, we prove that the optimal policy of the CMDP has a threshold structure using a Lagrangian relaxation approach and the submodularity concept. We accordingly present a fast Q-learning algorithm by considering the policy structure to improve the convergence speed over that of conventional Q-learning.

Currently, MDM is based on light-weight algorithms that are adaptive in resource-constrained environments but a study to evaluate the performance of general algorithms still lacks in the literature. To this end, we have studied six Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) algorithms and deployed them in mobile devices to evaluate the feasibility and highlighted the associated challenges. The experiments were performed on real and synthetic data sets strictly in android-based mobile device and compared with PC-based setup. The experimental results show that FPM algorithms can leverage MDM after tuning some basic parameters.},

abstract = {Modern cities continuously struggle with infrastructural problems especially when the population is massively growing. One affected area is public transportation. In default of offering convenient and reliable service the passengers tend to consider other transport alternatives. However, even a relatively simple functional enhancement, such as providing real-time timetable information, requires considerable investment and effort following traditional means, e.g. deploying sensors and building a background communication and processing infrastructure. Using the power of crowd to gather the required data, share information and send feedback is a viable and cost effective alternative. In this demonstration, we present TrafficInfo, our prototype smart phone application to implement a participatory sensing based live public transport information service. TrafficInfo visualizes the actual position of public transport vehicles with live updates on a map, and gives support to crowd sourced data collection and passenger feedback.},

This paper presents an intelligent, ant-colony-based path planning algorithm that is applicable to scenic areas. The proposed algorithm modifies the ants' ending tour to achieve partial point traversal of the connected graph by eliminating the restriction of the ant colony algorithm taboo table. A temporary weight matrix is introduced so that the algorithm avoids the repeated selection of smaller-weight paths, improving its overall efficiency. The experimental results show that the improved ant colony algorithm proposed in this paper is more effective and efficient than other algorithms and more suitable to solve the path planning problem in one scenic area with many spots.},

abstract = {In participatory sensing (PS), users use smartphones to collect information related to a certain phenomenon of interest, and report their sensed data to the service provider through cellular or Wi-Fi networks. Previous studies on the incentive mechanism design for user participation often neglect the details of data reporting, which is non-trivial given the user mobility, location-dependent network availability, and transmission cost. In this paper, we study the decisions of the service provider and the users in PS applications that involve photo or video transmissions, where the reporting cost through the cellular network is non-negligible. The service provider uses a deadline reward scheme to motivate users to participate, and optimizes its reward to maximize its expected surplus. Users make their participation and reporting decisions based on the reward announced by the service provider. We jointly consider the user mobility and multiple access methods with different transmission costs and location heterogeneity in the problem formulation and analysis. For the general case with a time-discounted reward, we formulate a user's reporting decision problem as a sequential decision problem, and propose an optimal participation and reporting decisions (OPRD) algorithm using dynamic programming. For the special case with a fixed reward, we derive the closed-form participation and reporting decisions. Simulation results show that the OPRD algorithm improves the user payoff over the patient and impatient schemes by 9.8{\%} and 13.2{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {The accuracy of localization methods based on the arrival time difference is usually affected by the iterative algorithm, the initial value, and the pre-measured wave velocity. The analytical solutions are non-unique because of the square root operations in the calculating process for source coordinates. To solve these significant problems, the nonlinear equations were simplified to the linear equations. An analytical localization method without the pre-measured velocity or the square root operations was developed. The explicit formulas for analytical solutions were resolved for the six sensors network. The source coordinates can be solved for real time by substituting the arrival times and coordinates of sensors. Focusing on the practical engineering where the number of sensors is greater than six, the comprehensive analytical solutions were proposed on account of sensor networks, which formed through the combination of different sensors, and the logistic probability density function. The blasting tests in two mines verified its effectiveness and accuracy. Results show that the locating accuracy of three dimensional comprehensive analytical solutions is superior to the traditional methods. The assumed examples proved that the proposed method performs well under different scales of arrival time errors. This proposed method highlights four advantages: without iterative algorithm, without pre-measured velocity, without initial value, and without square root operations.},

Research is underway to extend today's diversity of vendor-designed "walled garden" repositories, ultimately repositioning individuals as producers, consumers, and remixers of a vast openly shared public data set. By empowering people to easily measure, report, and compare their own personal environments, such tools transform everyday citizens into reporting agents who uncover and visualize unseen elements of their own everyday experiences. With this important new shift in mobile device usage - from a communication tool to a ubiquitous "experience sharing instrument" - comes a new dimension in trust and privacy challenges. Today's privacy and trust tools that address web surfing and simple location-based services already struggle to be adopted in practice. We argue that in order to prepare for tomorrow's sensor sharing, privacy and trust must be addressed holistically, incorporating both technical approaches and actual sharing behavior.

By scalability, we refer to both the challenges of data capture from a large number of users, as well as the issues of energy consumed on individual devices as a result of that capture. In this paper, we present mobile/on-board data stream mining as an effective approach to address the scalability issues of mobile data collection and run-time processing and as a significant component of mobile run-time analytics. We present experimental evaluation using the Nokia mobile data challenge open track dataset to show the significant energy and bandwidth savings that mobile data stream mining can achieve with no significant loss of useful information in this process.},

In particular, community response networks formed by mobile users/devices communicating by using only heterogeneous wireless ad hoc links, called herein CRHWNs, can exploit context awareness, defined as the capability of providing applications with full awareness of execution context. In fact, the correct and timely distribution of the current situation, such as health state and position of injured people, can substantially improve community coordination, thus increasing the possibility of saving human lives. Unfortunately, real-world context-aware services in disaster area scenarios require efficient, reliable, and scalable context data distribution and retrieval, and these properties clash with the limited resources usually supported by mobile devices and wireless communications. Along that direction, this article presents our context data distribution infrastructure for CRHWNs, which achieves data distribution efficiency and reliability by also exploiting useful quality indicators, such as data retrieval time and trustworthiness. We also show how our solution increases context data distribution/retrieval scalability by dynamically self-adapting (a limited number of) data distribution paths and optimizing context data pushing to interested consumers. Experimental results validate our main assumptions and demonstrate how our solution introduces a limited runtime overhead. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper we focus on the problem of information discovery by data consumers who can pose queries to mobile users providing sensed data. The way to protect the privacy of these mobile users is through the use of cloud-based agents, which obfuscate user location and enforce the sharing practices of their owners. The cloud agents organise themselves in a structure, namely a quadtree, that enables queriers to contact directly the mobile users in the area of interest and, based on their own criteria, select the ones to get sensing data from. The tree is kept in a decentralized manner, stored and maintained by the mobile agents themselves, thus avoiding the privacy implications of previous, centralized techniques. Our proposed solution complements and expands upon prior work in the area while it is shown experimentally to be both scalable, efficient and easy to maintain.},

They show that few channels in 2.4GHz are heavily used; in contrast, there is hardly any activity in the 5GHz band even though relatively it has a greater number of available channels. Spatial analysis of spectrum usage reveals that mutual interference among nearby APs operating in the same channel can be a serious problem with around 10 APs contending with each other in many locations. We find that the characteristics of WiFi deployments at city-scale are similar to that of WiFi deployments in public spaces of different indoor environments. We validate our approach in comparison with wardriving, and also show that our findings generally match with previous studies based on other measurement approaches. As an application of the mobile crowdsensing based urban WiFi monitoring, we outline a cloud based WiFi router configuration service for better interference management with global awareness in urban areas.},

In dealing with aforementioned challenges, we first make statistical analysis on the popularity of the contents according to real trace data. According to our preliminary observations, we made priority evaluation for different items. We re-evaluate the distribution effects when priority is concerned. Furthermore, we improved our user selection algorithm incorporating the popularity. Evaluation results have shown the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Doors are important landmarks for indoor positioning systems. Hence an accurate and light-weight door detection approach is highly desired. The state-of-the-art solutions are either vision based or infrastructure based, which incur nontrivial device or management cost. This paper presents a novel approach, Light-weight Magnetic-based Door Detection (LMDD), which only relies on the information from built-in sensors of a smartphone. LMDD detects a door by analyzing the change of magnetic signal and extracting special features caused by doors. It is light-weight in both computation and infrastructure cost. We have implemented a prototype of LMDD that has been installed on various Android phones. Experimental results show that LMDD achieves door detection accuracy of 74{\%} in average, ranging from 66{\%} to 85{\%} in various typical environments such as offices, classrooms, residential houses, and a hospital.},

abstract = {In the past decade, with the rapid development of wireless communication and sensor technology, ubiquitous smartphones equipped with increasingly rich sensors have more powerful computing and sensing abilities. Thus, mobile crowdsensing has received extensive attentions from both industry and academia. Recently, plenty of mobile crowdsensing applications come forth, such as indoor positioning, environment monitoring, transportation, and so on. However, most existing mobile crowdsensing systems lack of vast user bases, and thus urgently need appropriate incentive mechanisms to attract mobile users to guarantee the service quality. In this paper, we propose to incorporate sensing platform and social network applications, which already have large user bases to build a three-layer network model. Thus, we can publicize the sensing platform promptly in large scale, and provide longterm guarantee of data sources. Based on a three-layer network model, we design incentive mechanisms for both intermediaries and the crowdsensing platform, and provide a solution to cope with the problem of user overlapping among intermediaries. We indicate the properties of our proposed incentive mechanisms, including incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and efficiency.},

However, existing crowdsourcing approaches require all video files to be uploaded, wasting a large amount of bandwidth since not all crowdsourced videos are useful. Moreover, it is difficult for applications to find desired videos based on user-generated annotations, which can be inaccurate or miss important information. To address these issues, we present VideoMec, a video crowdsourcing system that automatically generates video descriptions based on various geographical and geometrical information, called metadata, from multiple embedded sensors in off-the-shelf mobile devices. With VideoMec, only a small amount of metadata needs to be uploaded to the server, hence reducing the bandwidth and energy consumption of mobile devices. Based on the uploaded metadata, VideoMec supports comprehensive queries for applications to find and fetch desired videos. For time-sensitive applications, it may not be possible to upload all desired videos in time due to limited wireless bandwidth and large video files. Thus, we formalize two optimization problems and propose efficient algorithms to select the most important videos to upload under bandwidth and time constraints. We have implemented a prototype of VideoMec, evaluated its performance, and demonstrated its effectiveness based on real experiments.},

Such systems have been successfully adopted in the context of wireless emergency services, tactical military operations, and various other applications offering location-based services. In current and previous generation of cellular systems, i.e., 3G, 4G, and LTE, the base stations, which have known locations, have been assumed to be stationary and fixed. However, with the possibility of having mobile relays in 5G networks, there is a demand for novel algorithms that address the challenges that did not exist in the previous generations of localization systems. This paper includes a review of various fundamental techniques, current trends, and state-of-the-art systems and algorithms employed in wireless position estimation using moving receivers. Subsequently, performance criteria comparisons are given for the aforementioned techniques and systems. Moreover, a discussion addressing potential research directions when dealing with moving receivers, e.g., receiver's movement pattern for efficient and accurate localization, non-line-of-sight problem, sensor fusion, and cooperative localization, is briefly given.},

abstract = {For participatory sensing, task allocation is a crucial research problem that embodies a tradeoff between sensing quality and cost. An organizer usually publishes and manages multiple tasks utilizing one shared budget. Allocating multiple tasks to participants, with the objective of maximizing the overall data quality under the shared budget constraint, is an emerging and important research problem. We propose a fine-grained multitask allocation framework (MTPS), which assigns a subset of tasks to each participant in each cycle. Specifically, considering the user burden of switching among varying sensing tasks, MTPS operates on an attention-compensated incentive model where, in addition to the incentive paid for each specific sensing task, an extra compensation is paid to each participant if s/he is assigned with more than one task type. Additionally, based on the prediction of the participants' mobility pattern, MTPS adopts an iterative greedy process to achieve a near-optimal allocation solution. Extensive evaluation based on real-world mobility data shows that our approach outperforms the baseline methods, and theoretical analysis proves that it has a good approximation bound.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.With the availability of inexpensive sensors, the attractiveness of participatory sensing has increased tremendously in the last decade. However, when sensing is performed with devices owned by individuals, it raises several privacy issues with respect to the data producers, and hence reduces the incentive to contribute to the services. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which a malicious server in a crowdsourcing air quality monitoring service can track the locations of users that contribute to the service. The participants periodically send information, such as temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, and luminosity of their surrounding, using an off-the-shelf sensor connected to their mobile phones. The participants also send their coarse-grain location (i.e., disclosing the ID of the cell tower to which their mobile is coupled) along with the air quality data. We evaluate the precision with which the attacker can track the participants using only air quality data and location of the cell tower. We perform a thorough analysis of the privacy attack and show that it can accurately discover the destination of the users with a precision of more than 85{\%} (up to 97{\%}), if at least five consecutive samples are provided by the participants. We also discovered that the precision drops when the environmental sensors are affected by outside conditions (e.g., exposition to direct sunlight) but remains significant (54.5{\%} for 20 consecutive samples).},

abstract = {Understanding the irregular crowd movement and social activities caused by urban events such as city festivals and concerts can benefit event management and city planning. Although various urban data can be exploited to detect such irregularities, the crowd mobility data (e.g., bike trip records) are usually in a mixed state with several basic patterns (e.g., eating, working, and recreation), making it difficult to separate concurrent events happening in the same region. The social activity data (e.g., social network check-ins) are usually oversparse, hindering the fine-grained characterization of urban events. In this paper, we propose a tensor cofactorization-based data fusion framework for fine-grained urban event detection and characterization leveraging crowd mobility data and social activity data. First, we adopt a nonnegative tensor cofactorization approach to decompose the crowd mobility tensor into several basic patterns, with the help of the auxiliary social activity tensor. We then use a multivariate-outlier-detection-based method to identify irregularities from the decomposed basic patterns and aggregate them to detect and characterize the associated urban events. We evaluate the performance of our framework using real-world bike trip data and check-in data from New York City and Washington, DC, respectively. Results show that by fusing the two types of urban data, our method achieves fine-grained urban event detection and characterization in both cities and consistently outperforms the baselines.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal signal reconstruction from samples randomly gathered in a multidimensional space with uncertainty is a crucial problem for a variety of applications. Such a problem generalizes the reconstruction of a deterministic signal and that of a stationary random process in one dimension, which was first addressed by Whittaker, Kotelnikov, and Shannon. In this work we analyze multidimensional random sampling with uncertainties jointly accounting for signal properties (signal spectrum and spatial correlation) and for sampling properties (inhomogeneous sample spatial distribution, sample availability, and non-ideal knowledge of sample positions). The reconstructed signal spectrum and the signal reconstruction accuracy are derived as a function of signal and sampling properties. It is shown that some of these properties expand the signal spectrum while others modify the spectrum without expansion. The signal reconstruction accuracy is first determined in a general case and then specialized for cases of practical interests. The optimal interpolator function is derived and asymptotic results are obtained to show the impact of sampling non-idealities. The analysis is corroborated by verifying that previously known results can be obtained as special cases of the general one and by means of a case study accounting for various settings of signal and sample properties. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

One core protocol for messaging in those settings is the widely adopted publish/subscribe protocol MQTT. Pub/sub protocols, however, were not designed for this particular scenario and have decoupling properties that make some common task in IoT settings more challenging to achieve. It is, for instance, not straightforward to discover potential publishers of sensor data or to give guarantees that all, a certain number or at least one subscriber of a certain set of possible subscribers will received a message. Because they are missing in the standard, different approaches and implementations tackling those challenges will lead to incompatibilities between users of different systems. In this work, we therefore give an overview of the challenges with discovery and guaranteed delivery to a certain number of subscribers over pub/sub networks in IoT settings and present different possible solutions.

Co-located people can dynamically form ad-hoc mobile community response networks (CRNs) to provide anywhere and anytime care assistance to users with critical physical/behavioral conditions after a disaster occurrence or even during their normal day-life while on the move.

abstract = {Mobile crowd photographing (MCP) is an emerging area of interest for researchers as the built-in cameras of mobile devices are becoming one of the commonly used visual logging approaches in our daily lives. In order to meet diverse MCP application requirements and constraints of sensing targets, a multifacet task model should be defined for a generic MCP data collection framework. Furthermore, MCP collects pictures in a distributed way in which a large number of contributors upload pictures whenever and wherever it is suitable. This inevitably leads to evolving picture streams. This paper investigates the multiconstraint-driven data selection problem in MCP picture aggregation and proposes a pyramid-tree (PTree) model which can efficiently select an optimal subset from the evolving picture streams based on varied coverage needs of MCP tasks. By utilizing the PTree model in a generic MCP data collection framework, which is called CrowdPic, we test and evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of the proposed framework through crowdsourcing-based and simulation-based experiments. Both the theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the PTree-based framework can effectively select a subset with high utility coverage and low redundancy ratio from the streaming data. The overall framework is also proved flexible and applicable to a wide range of MCP task scenarios. {\&}copy; 2017 IEEE.},

To save energy and protect environment, recommending fuel-efficient routes to drivers becomes a promising way to alleviate this issue. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel fuel-efficient path-planning framework called GreenPlanner, which contains two phases. In the first phase, we build a personalized fuel consumption model (PFCM) for each driver, based on the individual driving behaviors and the physical features (e.g., traffic lights, stop signs, road network topology) along the routes. In the second phase, with the real-time traffic information collected via the mobile crowdsensing manner, we are able to estimate and compare the cost fuel among different routes for a given driver, and recommend him/her with the most fuel-efficient one. We evaluate the two-phase framework using the real-world datasets, consisting of road network, POI, the GPS trajectory data and the OBD-II data generated by 559 taxis in one day in the city of Beijing, China. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline models, the proposed model achieves the best accuracy, with a mean fuel consumption error of less 7{\%} for paths longer than 10 km. Moreover, users could save about 20{\%} fuel consumption on average if driving along our suggested routes in our case studies.},

abstract = {Via processing the computation intensive applications (apps) at the network edge, mobile edge computing (MEC) becomes a promising technology to enhance the ability of the user equipments (UEs). Most existing works usually focus on whether to offload or where to offload the apps under the premise that sufficient resources are owned by the network edge. However, the demand heterogeneity of UEs and the limitation of resources are usually failed to be considered. Since the limited resources may constrain the number of accessed UEs, how the MEC service providers (SPs) choose the UEs to serve while ensuring UEs' Quality of Service (QoS) is a key issue. Under this context, in this paper, we study the matching problem between the MEC SPs and the UEs in a multi-MEC and multi-UE scenario. Within this scenario, MEC SPs are equipped with limited wireless and computational resources. Auction theory is utilized to model the matching relationship between MEC SPs and UEs as the commodity trading. With this trading, UEs can obtain MEC service from SPs, when they successfully purchase the combinational resources (including computational and wireless resources) from SPs. To complete the auction process, a multi-round-sealed sequential combinatorial auction mechanism is proposed. The properties of the auction are proved and various simulation results are done to show that the proposed approach has better system performance compared with the existing algorithms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE. Piggyback crowdsensing (PCS) is a novel energy- efficient mobile crowdsensing paradigm that reduces the energy consumption of crowdsensing tasks by leveraging smartphone app opportunities (SAOs). This article, based on several fundamental assumptions of incentive payment for PCS task participation and spatial-temporal coverage assessment for collected sensor data, first proposes two alternating data collection goals. Goal 1 is maximizing overall spatial-temporal coverage under a predefined incentive budget constraint; goal 2 is minimizing total incentive payment while ensuring predefined spatial-temporal coverage for collected sensor data, all on top of the PCS task model. With all of the above assumptions, settings, and models, we introduce CrowdMind - a generic incentive allocation framework for the two optimal data collection goals, on top of the PCS model. We evaluated CrowdMind extensively using a large-scale real-world SAO dataset for the two incentive allocation problems. The results demonstrate that compared to baseline algorithms, CrowdMind achieves better spatial-temporal coverage under the same incentive budget constraint, while costing less in total incentive payments and ensuring the same spatial-temporal coverage, under various coverage/incentive settings. Further, a short theoretical analysis is presented to analyze the performance of Crowd- Mind in terms of the optimization with total incentive cost and overall spatial-temporal coverage objectives/constraints.},

abstract = {The pervasive computing discipline has evolved substantially since its inception. A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues. I will present use cases, highlight the challenges, describe our approaches, and relate to client expe- iences.},

In order to solve the inadequate sensing opportunities provided by an MCS system, we focus on building a Hybrid Crowd Sensing (HCS) network by organizing both static and uncontrolled mobile nodes. We use the static node central opportunistic coverage to measure the sensing quality of HCS by analyzing the different features of coverage in the three regions and forming definitions. Our proposed approach can enable the static nodes to be deployed in the traditional hexagonal lattice, and mobile nodes to be located by smaller hexagonal lattices. Moreover, the analysis results demonstrate that the hexagonal lattice is more economical in both the number of mobile nodes needed by the seamless coverage SSA and network connectivity with the square grid. Finally, we make further analysis of the stream successful transmission probability, and find out that there are many complex influence factors of the static node central opportunistic coverage, such as the size of the time window T, the relative position of the start location and the end location, the number of mobile nodes participates stream transmission, mobile strategy of mobile nodes, opportunistic delegation mechanism, opportunistic routing mechanism, and so on. We modelize the lower limitation of it by a discrete Markov chain, and the simulation results show both the feasibility and rationality of using the static node central opportunistic coverage as the sensing quality metric.},

This inspires us to study how human behavior dynamically changes over time at an emergency in a complex indoor environment. In this paper, we refer the panic of evacuees to their perception of the threat and propose a panic propagation model to model how crowd panic changes during evacuation at an emergency. Combined with the existing social force model, our panic model interprets the self-driven force and interactive forces with others in human mobility. To improve evacuation efficiency, robots are introduced to guide evacuees to escape. Using dynamic environment information, we design an evacuation exit selection algorithm where the optimal exit is automatically selected by the robot with the minimum escape time. In our experiments, a real shopping mall is examined, and the dynamic behavior of panicked evacuees is simulated with the proposed panic model. The evacuation performance of using emergency evacuation robots is evaluated. The improvement of evacuation efficiency validates the effectiveness of our robot-assisted evacuation system.},

Furthermore, we observe that the sensing user's benefits not only depend on their own contribution, but also rely on the outcome of the final data transaction between the service provider and the mediator. However, this data transaction is vulnerable to the prisoner's dilemma due to the selfish choice of the both parties.

abstract = {—In mobile crowdsensing (MCS), one of the partici-pants' main concerns is the cost for 3G data usage, which affects their willingness to participate in a crowdsensing task. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an MCS data uploading mechanism—ecoSense—to help reduce additional 3G data cost incurred by the whole crowd of sensing partici-pants. By considering the two most common real-life 3G price plans—unlimited data plan (UnDP) and pay as you go (PAYG), ecoSense partitions all the users into two groups correspond-ing to these two price plans at the beginning of each month, with the objective of minimizing the total refunding budget for all participants. The partitioning is based on predicting users' mobility patterns and sensed data size. The ecoSense mecha-nism is designed inspired by the observation that during the data uploading cycles, UnDP users could opportunistically relay PAYG users' data to the crowdsensing server without extra 3G cost, pro-vided the two types of users are able to " meet " on a common local cost-free network (e.g., Bluetooth or WiFi direct). We conduct our experiments using both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reality mining and the Small World In Motion (SWIM) simu-lation data sets. Evaluation results show that ecoSense could reduce total 3G data cost by up to ∼50{\%}, when compared to the direct-assignment method that assigns each participant to UnDP or PAYG directly according to the size of her sensed data.

abstract = {Human{\&}{\#}x2013;machine systems required a deep understanding of human behaviors. Most existing research on action recognition has focused on discriminating between different actions, however, the quality of executing an action has received little attention thus far. In this paper, we study the quality assessment of driving behaviors and present WiQ, a system to assess the quality of actions based on radio signals. This system includes three key components, a deep neural network based learning engine to extract the quality information from the changes of signal strength, a gradient-based method to detect the signal boundary for an individual action, and an activity-based fusion policy to improve the recognition performance in a noisy environment. By using the quality information, WiQ can differentiate a triple body status with an accuracy of 97{\&}{\#}x0025;, whereas for identification among 15 drivers, the average accuracy is 88{\&}{\#}x0025;. Our results show that, via dedicated analysis of radio signals, a fine-grained action characterization can be achieved, which can facilitate a large variety of applications, such as smart driving assistants.},

The inherent mobility of such devices has the capacity to produce dense and rich spatiotemporal information about our environment creating the mobile Internet of Things (IoT). The management of mobile resources to enable sensor discovery and seamless integration of mobile geotagged sensor data with cloud-based IoT platforms creates new challenges due to device dynamicity, energy constraints, and varying sensor data quality. The paper presents an ecosystem for mobile crowdsensing applications which relies on the CloUd-based PUblish/Subscribe middleware (CUPUS) to acquire sensor data from mobile devices in a context-aware and energy-efficient manner. The ecosystem offers the means for location management of mobile Internet-connected objects and adaptive data acquisition from such devices. In addition, our solution enables filtering of sensor data on mobile devices in the proximity of a data producer prior to its transmission into the cloud. Thus it reduces both the network traffic and energy consumption on mobile devices. We evaluate the performance of our mobile CUPUS application to investigate its performance on mobile phones in terms of scalability and CPU, memory and energy consumption under high publishing load.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm makes the Internet more pervasive where objects equipped with computing, storage, and sensing capabilities are interconnected with communication technologies. Because of the widespread diffusion of IoT devices, applying the IoT paradigm to smart cities is an excellent solution to build sustainable ICT platforms. Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques augments capabilities of these ICT platforms without additional costs. For proper operation, MCS systems require the contribution from a large number of participants. Simulations are therefore a candidate tool to assess the performance of MCS systems. In this paper, we illustrate the design of CrowdSenSim, a simulator for mobile crowdsensing. CrowdSenSim is designed specifically for realistic urban environments and smart cities services. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrowdSenSim for the most popular MCS sensing paradigms (participatory and opportunistic), and we present its applicability using a smart public street lighting scenario.},

abstract = {Wearable devices and Smartphones generate huge data streams in pervasive and ubiquitous environments. Traditionally, big data systems collect all the data at a central data processing system (DPS). These data silos are further analyzed to generate approximated patterns for different application areas. This approach has one-sided utility (i.e. at big data processing end) but two main side-effects that lead towards user's dissatisfaction and extra computational costs. These effects are: (1) since all the data is being collected at central DPS, user privacy is compromised and (2) the collection of huge raw data streams, most of which could be irrelevant, at central systems needs more computational and storage resources hence increases the overall operational cost. Keeping in view these limitations, we are proposing a unified framework that balances between utility and cost of big data system with increased user satisfaction. We studied different data mining systems and proposed a new framework, named as UniMiner, to leverage data mining systems with wearable devices, smartphones, and cloud computing technologies. The gist of UniMiner is the scalability of data mining tasks from resource-constraint devices to collaborative and hybrid execution models. This scalable unified data mining approach distinguishes UniMiner from existing systems by enabling maximum data processing near data sources. Finally, we assessed the feasibility of mobile devices using six frequent pattern mining algorithms. The results show that mobile devices could be adopted as data mining platforms by tuning some additional parameters.},

Previous studies either need large message overhead to achieve global maxima in influence computation or focus on relatively stable network topology. To tackle the dynamic topology, we present an influential user identification scheme that fully exploits the active mobile users, in which the stable-state property could be leveraged under information potential construction scheme. We also propose an efficient routing algorithm for reaching the global maxima without depending on specific routing protocols. The proposed scheme is validated with extensive simulations using both synthetic random-walk and real-world mobility traces. The results demonstrate that it achieves considerable performance on influential user identification and route construction with little overhead. Furthermore, we present a case of mobile data offloading, and the results show that our scheme could reduce the efficient data traffic by up to 79.2{\%}, compared with a baseline without data offloading.},

There have been extensive research works that propose incentive mechanisms for crowdsensing, but they all make the assumption that mobile users will positively complete the allocated sensing tasks. In this paper, we consider a new and practical scenario of crowdsensing, where a user may fail to complete the task with a certain probability. It is an important and emerging issue for the incentive mechanisms to ensure fault tolerance for each sensing task under such unreliable scenarios. We design reverse auctions to model the strategic interaction between the platform and mobile users, in which users' probability of success and cost to perform the tasks are private information. Considering the task execution uncertainty, the goal of the auction mechanism is to minimize the social cost of user recruitment, while guaranteeing the tasks to be completed with high probability. We prove that minimizing the social cost is an NP-hard problem, and design computationally efficient mechanisms that achieve good approximation ratio and economic-robust properties, e.g., strategy-proofness. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our mechanisms based on a real data set. The evaluation results show that our mechanisms outperform the heuristic algorithm and approach to the optimal solution.},

Due to the inherent selfishness of human and network's openness, the quality of the data submitted by the participants is not always satisfying. To cope with this problem, a dynamic-trust-based recruitment framework (DTRF) for MCS system is proposed to recruit suitable participants who are trustworthy and always submit high-quality sensing data on time. In this model, we first give the definition of trust, and evaluate the overall trust degree of the participant from multi-dimensional trust evaluation factors: direct trust, feedback trust and incentive function. Then we develop an adaptive weight allocation approach based on information entropy theory, and the algorithm realization is given. Extensive simulations verifies that DTRF can achieve good performance in terms of trustworthy participants selection and task completion rate, compared with trust without feedback model.},

However, with these researches, effective target coverage has been a recurrent issue due to various factors like conflict between sensors and excessive waiting time for targets to be covered. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm based on queuing theory in tandem with mobile crowd sensing to tackle these issues. To do this, first, we develop some models which are based on the birth-and-death mechanism (one of the tools in queuing theory) to determine how long a target has to wait, the mean busy period of sensors and mean idle period of sensors. While developing these models, we consider cases where there exist a single sensor and n-sensors in the system. Based on these models, we develop the required algorithm. The simulation result shows that as the number of sensors increases relative to the number of targets, an average time before a target gets discovered is 0.2 s and sensor utilization decreasing toward zero as the number of sensors increases.},

over time and analyzed using machine learning techniques. We show that
when smart devices are equipped with continuous verification
intelligence, it is possible to verify users with less than 10{\%} false
rejection probabilities, and the users can keep using the devices with
no interruption for biometric authentication 90{\%} of the time. In the

Among the sensing data, videos annotated with temporal-spatial metadata contain huge amount of information, but consume too much precious storage space. In this paper, we solve the problem of optimizing cloud-based video crowdsensing in three steps. First, we study the optimal transcoding problem on wearable and mobile cameras. We propose an algorithm to optimally select the coding parameters to fit more videos at higher quality on wearable and mobile cameras. Second, we empirically investigate the throughput of different file transfer protocols from wearable and mobile devices to cloud servers. We propose a real-time algorithm to select the best protocol under diverse network conditions, so as to leverage the intermittent WiFi access. Last, we look into the performance of cloud databases for sensor-annotated videos, and implement a practical algorithm to search videos overlapping with a target geographical region. Our measurement study on three popular opensource cloud databases reveals their pros and cons. The three proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations and experiments. The evaluation results show the practicality and efficiency of our algorithms and system. For example, our proposed transcoding algorithm outperforms existing approaches by 12 dB in video quality, 87{\%} in energy saving, and one-quarter in delivery delay. Another example is, by intelligently choosing a proper cloud database, our system may reduce the insertion time by up to one-third, or the lookup time by up to one-fourth.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization. Crowdsourcing was initially devised as a method for solving problems through soliciting contributions from a large online community. Crowdsourcing is facing new challenges to handle the increase of information in real-time from a vast number of sources in Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. Thus we seek to leverage the power of social web, smart-devices, sensors, etc., fusing these heterogeneous sources into distributed context information in order to enable novel crowdsourcing scenarios. This mandates research in efficient management of heterogeneous and distributed context information through logical-clustering. Logical-clustering can efficiently filter out similar context information obtained from distributed sources based on context similarity. However, the efficiency of logical-clustering is challenged by the distribution of context information in crowdsourcing scenarios. Publish/Subscribe mechanism can counter this challenge. To this end, we propose a scalable publish/subscribe model, MediaSense, which is based on p2p technologies. This paper presents our approach to a scalable logical-clustering concept. The evaluation of our approach applied to MediaSense can achieve a rate of approximately 3530 messages/sec for publish/subscribe events. Moreover, this approach further achieves 99{\%} increase for subscription matching and 163{\%} improvement in memory requirements in comparison with other approaches.},

abstract = {The diffusion of mobile devices equipped with sensing, computation, and communication capabilities is opening unprecedented possibilities for high-resolution, spatio-temporal mapping of several phenomena. This novel data generation, collection, and processing paradigm, termed crowdsensing, lays upon complex, distributed cyberphysical systems. Collective data gathering from heterogeneous, spatially distributed devices inherently raises the question of how to manage different quality levels of contributed data. In order to extract meaningful information, it is, therefore, desirable to the introduction of effective methods for evaluating the quality of data. In this paper, we propose an approach aimed at systematic accuracy estimation of quantities provided by end-user devices of a crowd-based sensing system. This is obtained thanks to the combination of statistical bootstrap with uncertainty propagation techniques, leading to a consistent and technically sound methodology. Uncertainty propagation provides a formal framework for combining uncertainties, resulting from different quantities influencing a given measurement activity. Statistical bootstrap enables the characterization of the sampling distribution of a given statistics without any prior assumption on the type of statistical distributions behind the data generation process. The proposed approach is evaluated on synthetic benchmarks and on a real world case study. Cross-validation experiments show that confidence intervals computed by means of the presented technique show a maximum 1.5{\%} variation with respect to interval widths computed by means of controlled standard Monte Carlo methods, under a wide range of operating conditions. In general, experimental results confirm the suitability and validity of the introduced methodology. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Energy consumption and mobile data cost are two key factors affecting users' willingness to participate in mobile crowd-sensing tasks. While data-plan (DP) users are mostly concerned with energy consumption, non-data-plan (NDP) users are more sensitive to data cost. Traditional ways of data uploading in mobile crowdsensing tasks often go to two extremes: either in real time or completely offline after the whole task is over. In this paper, we propose effSense-an energy-efficient and cost-effective data uploading framework, which utilizes adaptive uploading schemes within fixed data uploading cycles. In each cycle, effSense empowers the participants with a distributed decision making scheme to choose the appropriate timing and network to upload data. effSense reduces data cost for NDP users by maximally offloading data to Bluetooth/WiFi gateways or DP users encountered; it reduces energy consumption for DP users by piggybacking data on a call or using more energy-efficient networks rather than initiating new 3G connections. By leveraging the predictability of users' calls and mobility, effSense selects proper uploading strategies for both user types. Our evaluation with the MIT reality mining and Nodobo datasets shows that effSense can reduce 55{\%}-65{\%} energy consumption for DP users, and 48{\%}-52{\%} data cost for NDP users, respectively, compared to traditional uploading schemes. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present SemSense: a crowdsourcing-based system for automatic enrichment of indoor floorplans with semantic labels. SemSense exploits phone sensors data collected from users during their normal check-ins to location-based social networks (LBSNs) and combines them with data extracted from the LBSNs databases to associate a venue name with its location on an unlabeled floorplan. At the core of SemSense are different modules for handling incorrect location estimates, fake check-ins, as well as increasing the coverage of indoor venues by means of a novel category inference technique. Our experimental evaluation of SemSense using different Android phones in four malls in two cities shows that it can achieve a high semantic labeling accuracy of 87{\%} using a relatively small number of check-ins at each venue in the presence of up to 50{\%} erroneous check-ins. In addition, the proposed coverage extension technique leads to more than 27{\%} enhancement in the places coverage ratio compared to the current LBSNs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Approximately 1 in 8 U.S. women will be diagnosed with new invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. An estimated 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S. in 2017. Mastectomy is recommended in over a third of early-stage breast cancer patients. Those women who elect to undergo breast reconstruction are counseled on surgical risks and benefits of implant-based and autologous reconstruction. Currently, there is limited patient-centered information about course of recovery, which is a major consideration when deciding between types of reconstruction. Patient recovery estimates are often anecdotally related to the length or invasiveness of the surgical procedure rather than patient-centered, evidence-based data on implant versus autologous surgical recovery. This deficit in information on patient recovery comes at a time when real-time digital devices are used to track vitals, sleep-wake cycles, and steps taken for personal convenience without being used to guide treatment. The primary objective of this paper is to present a system framework for modeling the surgical recovery process. We also outline preliminary results from a pilot study with two breast cancer patients who each underwent one of the two reconstruction surgeries.},

While most existing solutions are pattern-based, applying machine learning techniques, there is a recent trend of developing accurate models to reveal the underlining radio propagation properties and exploit models for fine-grained human behavior recognition. In this article, we first classify the existing work into two categories: pattern-based and model-based recognition solutions. Then we review and examine the two approaches together with their enabled applications. Finally, we show the favorable properties of model-based approaches by comparing them using human respiration detection as a case study, and argue that our proposed Fresnel zone model could be a generic one with great potential for device-free human sensing using fine-grained WiFi CSI.},

With the integrated embedded hardware and software sensor components, and mobile network technologies, smartphones are capable of providing various environmental context information via embedded mobile device-hosted Web services (MWS). MWS enhance the capability of various mobile sensing applications such as mobile crowd sensing, real time mobile health monitoring, mobile social network in proximity and so on. Although recent smartphones are quite capable in terms of mobile data transmission speed and computation power, the frequent usage of high performance multi-core mobile CPU and the high speed 3G/4G mobile Internet data transmission will quickly drain the battery power of the mobile device. Numerous previous researches have tried to overcome the resource intensive issues in mobile embedded service provisioning domain. However, most of the efforts were constrained because of the underlying resource intensive technologies. This paper proposes a lightweight mobile Web service provisioning framework for mobile sensing. The framework utilizes the technologies that were designed for constrained Internet of Things environment to achieve the lightweight mobile Web service provisioning. The prototype experimental results show that the proposed framework can provide higher throughput and less resource consumption than the traditional mobile Web service frameworks.},

abstract = {As a significant business paradigm, data trading has attracted increasing attention. However, the study of data acquisition in data markets is still in its infancy. Mobile crowdsensing has been recognized as an efficient and scalable way to acquire large-scale data. Designing a practical data acquisition scheme for crowd-sensed data markets has to consider three major challenges: crowd-sensed data trading format determination, profit maximization with polynomial computational complexity, and payment minimization in strategic environments. In this paper, we jointly consider these design challenges, and propose VENUS, which is the first profit-driVEN data acqUiSition framework for crowd-sensed data markets. Specifically, VENUS consists of two complementary mechanisms: VENUS-PRO for profit maximization and VENUS-PAY for payment minimization. Given the expected payment for each of the data acquisition points, VENUS-PRO greedily selects the most {\&}{\#}x201C;cost-efficient{\&}{\#}x201D; data acquisition points to achieve a sub-optimal profit. To determine the minimum payment for each data acquisition point, we further design VENUS-PAY, which is a data procurement auction in Bayesian setting. Our theoretical analysis shows that VENUS-PAY can achieve both strategy-proofness and optimal expected payment. We evaluate VENUS on a public sensory data set, collected by Intel Research, Berkeley Laboratory. Our evaluation results show that VENUS-PRO approaches the optimal profit, and VENUS-PAY outperforms the canonical second-price reverse auction, in terms of total payment.},

Considering that the sensing data collected by mobile users are normally noisy and imprecise, one of the pressing problems in mobile crowdsensing is to evaluate the data quality in real time and to steer users to acquire data with high quality. However, it is challenging to estimate the data quality without the availability of ground truth data. In this paper, we observe that sensing context has a significant impact on data quality, which motivates us to propose a context-aware data quality estimation scheme. With historical sensing data, we train a context-quality classifier, which captures the relation between context information and data quality, to estimate data quality in an online manner. We apply such a context-aware data quality estimation scheme to guide user recruitment in mobile crowdsensing. We model the process of user recruitment as a stochastic submodular maximization problem, and design a random adaptive greedy algorithm to guarantee a constant approximation ratio. We evaluate our algorithm on a real-world temperature data set. The evaluation results show that our algorithm outperforms other existing techniques, in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Using a low energy-consumption application, we have used the smartphones inertial sensor as an accelerograph. The deployed smartphones and the application form a low-cost wireless sensor network, that detects, analyzes and notifies a seismic-peak. The systems optimizes the distributed calculations in the smartphones; communication capabilities and integration in order to provide extra time for early warning in disaster scenarios (e.g. earthquakes), although the architecture may be extended to other disruptive and rare events. We propose an innovative real-time solution which considers time and spatial analyzes, not present in another works, making it more precise and customizable, coupling it to the features of the geographical zone, network and resources, so as providing evidence of the feasibility of earthquake early warning using a dense network of cell phones. The architecture has been validated by extensive evaluation and the most relevant result has been the improvement in notifications delivery about a seismic-peak 12 seconds earlier than previous works in the epicenter zone, and a reduction in the number of false positives. Additionally the proposed architecture includes a post-event management to help users and strengthen coordination between aid-agencies in order to optimize human resources and time to implement measures in order to eliminate negative effects on the population.},

This paper studies the problem that how to promote the ability of crowdsensing for fine-grained environmental monitoring. Based on a new metric for measuring the sensing ability of crowdsensing, the resolution of sensing image, we propose a method of generating sensing images via crowdsensing networks and enhance the ability of crowdsensing from a data perspective. To achieve a higher resolution, we not only utilize temporal correlation of mobile sensing nodes but also fuse the sensory data with correlated environmental information. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to verify the promotion of resolution beyond traditional spatial interpolation-based approach.},

However, in service configuration models based on the current participatory sensing for which the cloud is a core component, there is a problem in that it is not possible to flexibly distribute information according to the data provisioning policy. In this paper, we propose a new sensor-based application platform based on a service configuration model that does not use a server or a cloud.

Services are built on top of data sensed in the city and then analyzed in order to enhance people's quality of life. Nowadays users are also able to participate in such a data gathering, mostly thanks to a reduction in the cost of the sensing devices. Moreover, smartphones encompass many useful sensors and can be leveraged to obtain data by end users on the move, within the scope of mobile crowdsensing. In this paper, we propose SenSquare, a mobile crowdsensing architecture for Smart Cities, built to embrace both data availability and devices heterogeneity. SenSquare also offers the possibility for stakeholders to reward users sharing their data. Finally, we compare our proposal against a non-smart ideal architecture, showing the benefits and the advantages of a smart architecture such as SenSquare.},

abstract = {Participatory sensing has emerged as a novel paradigm for data collection and collective knowledge formation about a state or condition of interest, sometimes linked to a geographic area. In this paper, we address the problem of incentive mechanism design for data contributors for participatory sensing applications. The service provider receives service queries in an area from service requesters and initiates an auction for user participation. Upon request, each user reports its perceived cost per unit of amount of participation, which essentially maps to a requested amount of compensation for participation. The participation cost quantifies the dissatisfaction caused to user due to participation. This cost is considered to be private information for each device, as it strongly depends on various factors inherent to it, such as the energy cost for sensing, data processing and transmission to the closest point of wireless access, the residual battery level, the number of concurrent jobs at the device processor, the required bandwidth to transmit data and the related charges of the mobile network operator, or even the user discomfort due to manual effort to submit data. Hence, participants have strong motive to mis-report their cost, i.e. declare a higher cost that the actual one, so as to obtain higher payment. We seek a mechanism for user participation level determination and payment allocation which is most viable for the provider, that is, it minimizes the total cost of compensating participants, while delivering a certain quality of experience to service requesters. We cast the problem in the context of optimal reverse auction design, and we show how the different quality of submitted information by participants can be tracked by the service provider and used in the participation level and payment selection procedures. We derive a mechanism that optimally solves the problem above, and at the same time it is individually rational (i.e., it motivates users to part- cipate) and incentive-compatible (i.e. it motivates truthful cost reporting by participants). Finally, a representative participatory sensing case study involving parameter estimation is presented, which exemplifies the incentive mechanism above.},

abstract = {As mobile crowd sensing (MCS) cannot provide reliable services, the quality of service (QoS) is a major research interest. Since the service node makes a decisive impact on two vital factors of QoS, service node selection is becoming a novel research direction in MCS. In this paper, we analyze the factors that need attention when selecting proper service nodes in MCS and define the service node selection problem (SNSP) as follows: finding the optimal set of service nodes, provided that optimizes multiple metrics of QoS simultaneously and satis- fies the network resource constraint. Accordingly, we formulate a multiobjective optimization model (MOOM), which converts SNSP to a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP). Since the MOOM considers the comprehensive effect of all service nodes on one metric as one objective of MOOP, it can handle the diversity of metrics and conflicts between them; in particular, it can flexibly change the metric system of QoS depending on different demands. To demonstrate the value and effectiveness of the proposed MOOM, we propose a paradigm of it and design a corresponding multiobjective optimization selection mechanism. This paradigm focuses on the influence of node spatiotemporal mobility on both data collection and data transmission. Extensive experiments and comparison on a real-world data show that MOOM is an effective model for selecting service nodes with both good coverage and transmission performances.},

abstract = {本文提出了一种群智物流的概念，即利用城市中大量的taxies在搭载乘客的同时，deliver the packages。场景是，在一个城市中，存在多个临时存放点，当一个人想寄送包裹从A点寄送到B点，则他先将这个包裹投递给最近的临时存放点，然后，各个taxies提交delivery ordering，然后将这个包裹从这个临时存放点搭载到另一个临时存放点，而另一个taxi再将这个包裹继续deliver，通过多个taxies的relay，最终投递到目的地临时存放点。因此， 这里主要包括两部分：一是offline基于历史taxies轨迹数据来估计从各个path的delivery time和出租车出现概率；二是online,当一个user提交一个delivery request时，系统根据前面offline估计的path delivery time和出租车出现概率来schedule path，即路径选择，以使delivery time最小。由于taxi delivery time和出现不是确定的，因此，只能基于概率统计来得到次优解。 文章的methdod 的detail没有细读。但是通过看这篇文章，发现这个场景的crowd-sourcing给incentive mechanism design带来新的变化。本质上，这个问题就是基于多个临时存放点的从一个起点到一个终点的路径规划问题。因此，从A点到B点有多条路径，经历多个relay点。每一段路径的每一段由一个taxi来bidding，因此，对于一段路径的各个taxies之间是合作的，而对于路径之间是竞争的。同时，一个taxi可以选择运送一段，也可以选择运送两段。因此，这个对于incentive mechanism，以及博弈更加复杂了。同时，把一个taxi提供的服务想象成task，则存在task 组合。因此，如果crowddeliver这个场景比较有意义，则基于它来考虑 incentive mechanism design，会给当前crowd-sourcing incentive mechanism research带来很多新问题。},

Then, several intuitive prediction methods are designed to predict nodes{\&}{\#}x2019; future temporal social contact patterns based on the observations from extensive real trace-driven simulation results. Afterward, based on the predicted temporal social contact patterns, we propose an efficient temporal closeness and centrality-based data forwarding strategy named TCCB for OMNs. The core idea of TCCB is to capture and utilize the temporal correlations to infer the future temporal social contact patterns in the remaining valid time of the data. Finally, extensive real trace-driven simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of TCCB. The results show that TCCB is close to Epidemic in terms of delivery ratio but with significantly reduced delivery cost. Furthermore, TCCB performs much better than Bubble Rap and Prophet in terms of delivery ratio, but the delivery cost of TCCB is very close to that of Bubble Rap.},

abstract = {Container ports are generally measured and compared using performance indicators such as container throughput and facility productivity. Being able to measure the performance of container ports quantitatively is of great importance for researchers to design models for port operation and container logistics. Instead of relying on the manually collected statistical information from different port authorities and shipping companies, we propose to leverage the pervasive ship GPS traces and maritime open data to derive port performance indicators, including ship traffic, container throughput, berth utilization, and terminal productivity. These performance indicators are found to be directly related to the number of container ships arriving at the terminals and the number of containers handled at each ship. Therefore, we propose a framework that takes the ships' container-handling events at terminals as the basis for port performance measurement. With the inferred port performance indicators, we further compare the strengths and weaknesses of different container ports at the terminal level, port level, and region level, which can potentially benefit terminal productivity improvement, liner schedule optimization, and regional economic development planning. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale real-world GPS traces of container ships collected from major container ports worldwide through the year, as well as various maritime open data sources concerning ships and ports. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework not only can accurately estimate various port performance indicators but also effectively produces port comparison results such as port performance ranking and port region comparison.},

In view of the facts that traditional traffic models are less effective in describing the new mobile internet applications and that the mobile user service behavior among regions with different levels of economic development are always different, a new modeling methodology of user service behavior specifically for mobile internet applications is proposed in this paper. Based on the crowdsourcing measurement data of the service behavior collected through massive end users in live mobile networks of China, the properties of three typical mobile internet services in three typical geographical regions are analyzed and compared with each other, by utilizing the proposed modeling methodology. And the relationships between some key properties of service behavior are analyzed with the maximal information coefficient method and the Pearson correlation coefficient method. The key parameters, differences, and internal relations among these services in typical geological regions of China are then identified. It provides a solid foundation for wireless product design, network planning, and optimization of mobile Internet services-oriented networks specifically in China, and is also a valuable reference for other countries of the similar situation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a spatial-temporal aware analytical framework to solve the truth finding problem in social sensing applications. Social sensing has emerged as a new big data application paradigm of collecting observations about the physical environment from social sensors (e.g., humans) or devices on their behalf. The collected observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. A fundamental challenge in social sensing applications lies in accurately ascertaining the correctness of claims and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori. This challenge is referred to as truth finding. Significant efforts have been made to address this challenge but two important features were largely missing in the state-of-the-arts solutions: when and where the claims are reported by a source. In this paper, we develop a new spatial-temporal aware truth finding scheme to explicitly incorporate the time information of a claim and location information of a source into a rigorous analytical framework. The new truth finding scheme solves a constraint optimization problem to determine both the source reliability and claim correctness. We evaluated the spatial-temporal aware truth finding scheme through both an extensive simulation study and a real world case study using Twitter data feeds. The evaluation results show that our new scheme outperforms all the compared state-of-the-art baselines and significantly improves the truth finding accuracy in social sensing applications.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors deployed around us and connected to the Internet, where the mobile crowd sensing technologies are widely used to collect data in different contexts of the IoT paradigm. Due to the popularity of Big Data technologies, processing and storing large volumes of data have become easier than ever. However, large-scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g., pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large-scale data collection and analysis. More importantly, not everyone has the financial and computational resources to deal with such large volumes of data. Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, specifically, location and activity-aware mobile sensing platform called context-aware mobile sensor data engine (C-MOSDEN) for the IoT domain. We evaluated the proposed platform using three real-world scenarios that highlight the importance of selective sensing. The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform are investigated and are used to highlight the advantages of context-aware selective sensing.},

abstract = {The exponential amount of geospatial data that has been accumulated in an accelerated pace has inevitably motivated the scientific community to examine novel parallel technologies for tuning the performance of spatial queries. Managing spatial data for an optimized query performance is particularly a challenging task. This is due to the growing complexity of geometric computations involved in querying spatial data, where traditional systems failed to beneficially expand. However, the use of large-scale and parallel-based computing infrastructures based on cost-effective commodity clusters and cloud computing environments introduces new management challenges to avoid bottlenecks such as overloading scarce computing resources, which may be caused by an unbalanced loading of parallel tasks. In this paper, we aim to fill those gaps by introducing a generic framework for optimizing the performance of big spatial data queries on top of Apache Spark. Our framework also supports advanced management functions including a unique self-adaptable load-balancing service to self-tune framework execution. Our experimental evaluation shows that our framework is scalable and efficient for querying massive amounts of real spatial datasets.},

Instead, classification is performed starting from probe requests Wi-Fi frames, which can be sniffed with inexpensive commercial hardware. We extract distinctive features from probe request frames (how many probe requests are transmitted by each device, how frequently, etc.) and take a machine learning approach, training four different classifiers to recognize the two types of devices. We compare the performance of the different classifiers and identify a solution based on a Random Decision Forest that correctly classify devices 95{\%} of the times. The classification method is then used as a pre-processing stage to analyze network traffic traces from the wireless network of a university building, with interesting considerations on the way different types of devices uses the network (amount of data exchanged, duration of connections, etc.). The proposed methodology finds application in many scenarios related to Wi-Fi network management/optimization and Wi-Fi based services.},

We then propose a truthful mechanism for achieving high service accuracy while protecting the privacy based on the user preferences. The users are incentivized to provide true data by being paid based on their individual contribution to the overall service accuracy. Moreover, we propose a coalition strategy which allows users to cooperate in providing their data under one identity, increasing their anonymity privacy protection, and sharing the resulting payoff.

In this paper we present the architecture of a system for the detection and management of emergencies in smart buildings. The designed architecture shows some novelties and key features which distinguish it from already existing solutions. Indeed, the proposed architecture exploits the existing building management systems leveraging mobile crowd sensing to collect valuable information during a crisis.

In this paper, we develop, ALSense, a distributed active learning framework for mobile crowdsensing. The goal is to minimize prediction errors for classification-based mobile crowdsensing tasks subject to upload and query cost constraints. Novel stream-based active learning strategies are developed to orchestrate queries of annotation data and the upload of unlabeled data from mobile devices.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALSense can indeed achieve higher classification accuracy given fixed data acquisition budgets for both applications.},

We collected pictures of 152 cracks with a specifically-developed android application by 8 volunteers. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90.1{\%} in crack type detection.

In this paper, we propose heuristics and devise a comparison methodology for new smart lighting solutions in next generation smart cities. The proposed smart lighting techniques make use of Internet of Things (IoT) augmented lampposts, which save energy by turning off or dimming the light in the absence of citizens nearby. Assessing costs and benefits in adopting the new smart lighting solutions is a pillar step for municipalities to foster real implementation. For evaluation purposes, we have developed a custom simulator which allows the deployment of lampposts in realistic urban environments. The citizens travel on foot along the streets and trigger activation of the lampposts according to the proposed heuristics. For the city of Luxembourg, the results highlight that replacing all existing lamps with LEDs and dimming light intensity in the absence of users in the vicinity of the lampposts is convenient and provides an economical return already after the first year of deployment.},

The great potential in using closer to the edge fog computing instead of Cloud computing to both enable faster and more privacy-aware processing locally has been recognized in the research community. In particular, on premise smart gateways can provide local low-latency storage and processing capabilities that are controlled locally and can be trusted. In this work, we outline a combined fog Cloud system that automatically selects a suitable execution location for processing tasks. We emphasize on the design challenges of such a system and further demonstrate a solution for the interplay between Fog and Cloud by showing how processing task can be migrated from one system to another on the fly without service interruption.},

Therefore, the mobile devices are augmented with cloud resources in mobile edge cloud computing (MECC) environments to seamlessly execute data mining tasks. The MECC infrastructures provide compute, network, and storage services in one-hop wireless distance from mobile devices to minimize the latency in communication as well as provide localized computations to reduce the burden on federated cloud systems. However, when and how to offload the computation is a hard problem. In this paper, we present an opportunistic computation offloading scheme to efficiently execute data mining tasks in MECC environments. The scheme provides the suitable execution mode after analyzing the amount of unprocessed data, privacy configurations, contextual information, and available on-board local resources (memory, CPU, and battery power). We develop a mobile application for online activity recognition and evaluate the proposed scheme using the event data stream of 5 million activities collected from 12 users for 15 days. The experiments show significant improvement in execution time and battery power consumption resulting in 98{\%} data reduction.},

However, these WiFi networks have been woefully undermeasured and underinstrumented during the wild expansion. We have closely collaborated with a leading network service provider to collect massive information about wireless APs and their users in four metropolises. In this article, based on the large-scale dataset, we attempt to answer the critical questions on how the APs are deployed and how they are utilized in urban areas. At the macro level, we depict the coverage of WiFi networks and the usage patterns, and by carefully classifying the APs, we unveil rich geographical features of today�s urban WiFi networks. At the micro level, we identify the implicit social relationships among WiFi users, and uncover the underlying social communities that have great potential for network optimization.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

Unfortunately, the static schedule information of the public transport vehicles, available at the stops, on the web or in some special format like GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification), usually does not reflect the actual traffic situation. However, realtime traffic updates require the gathering of an immense amount of tracking data. Mobile crowdsensing, via the mobile devices of the crowd, can offer a cheap and efficient way for collecting such data. Nonetheless, for motivating active participation some day zero service must be provided to the users. In this paper, we discuss how to realize a live public transport information service extending a static timetable based on GTFS data, as the day zero service, using the power of the crowd for data collection. We detail the design of such a service implemented by an XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) based mobile crowdsensing architecture and evaluate its performance. We show how we can build a scalable service architecture even with commodity hardware to handle thousands of users.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) play a significant role in the current transportation systems. The main factor that affects the acceptance of existing EV models is the range anxiety problem caused by limited charging stations and long recharge times. Recently, the solar-powered EV has drawn many attentions due to being free of charging limitations. However, the solarpowered EVs may still struggle with the limited use because of unpredictable solar availability. For example, shadings causedby buildings and trees also possibly decrease the solar panel cell efficiency. To address this, we propose a route planning method for solar-powered EVs to balance the energy harvesting and consumption subject to time constraint. The idea behindour solution is to offer power-aware optimal routing, which maximizes the on-road energy input given solar availability on each road segment. We first build a solar access estimation model using 3D geographic data and then employ a multi-criteriasearch method to generate a set of Pareto candidate routes. In order to reduce the size of the set, we leverage the bisect kmeans clustering algorithm to extract the most representative Pareto routes with better solar availability. In the evaluation, wedeveloped a validation platform on the vehicle and leveraged mobile sensing techniques to examine our proposed model in real road environments. We conducted simulations to evaluate our proposed route planning algorithm using real life scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our solar input model is robust to real road scenarios, and the routing algorithm has great potential to provide efficient services for solar-powered EV in the future.},

In-network processing pushes computational capabilities closer to the edge of the network, enabling new kinds of location-aware, real-time applications, while preserving bandwidth in the core network. This is done by offloading computations to more powerful or energy-efficient surrogates that are opportunistically available at the network edge. In mobile and heterogeneous usage contexts, the question arises how a client can discover the most appropriate surrogate in the network for offloading a task. In this paper, we propose a brokering mechanism that matches a client with the best available surrogate, based on specified requirements and capabilities. The broker is implemented on standard home routers, and thus, leverages the ubiquity of such devices in urban environments. To motivate the feasibility of this approach, we conduct a coverage analysis based on collected access point locations in a major city. Furthermore, the brokering functionality introduces only a minimal resource overhead on the routers and can significantly reduce the latency compared to distant, cloud-based solutions.},

A promising solution to address this problem in 5G systems is to use complementary technologies, such as Wi-Fi, to offload the traffic originally targeted toward cellular networks. In this article, we discuss the recent advances in the technologies and economics of two types of mobile data offloading: operator-initiated offloading and user-initiated offloading. In operator- initiated offloading, the mobile operators offload cellular traffic to Wi-Fi networks, which may belong to the mobile operators, mobile operators' residential subscribers, and third party Wi-Fi owners. In user-initiated offloading, the users decide how to offload traffic with or without the mobile operators' coordination. We present a taxonomy of various data offloading models, discuss various technical and economic challenges, and summarize the algorithms and mechanisms that we design to address these challenges. Finally, we outline some open problems that require further investigation.},

Smart cities exploit the most advanced information technologies to improve and add value to existing public services. Applying the IoT paradigm to smart cities is fundamental to build sustainable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platforms. Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques unleashes potential benefits as MCS augments the capabilities of the platform without additional costs. Recruitment of participants is a key challenge when MCS systems assign sensing tasks to the users. Proper recruitment both minimizes the cost and maximizes the return, such as the number and the accuracy of accomplished tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel user recruitment policy for data acquisition in mobile crowdsensing systems. The policy can be employed in two modes, namely sociability-driven mode and distance-based mode. Sociability stands for the willingness of users in contributing to sensing tasks. {\%}Furthermore, we propose a novel metric to assess the efficiency of any recruitment policy in terms of the number of users contacted and the ones actually recruited. Performance evaluation, conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants, reveals the effectiveness of sociability-driven user recruitment as the average number of recruited users improves by at least a factor of two.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Middleware was introduced to facilitate the development of sophisticated applications based on a uniform methodology and industry standards. However, early research and practice suggested that no one-size-fits-all approach was suitable for all application domains and scenarios. This gave rise to industry initiatives to standardize domain-specific middleware services and profiles, as well as research efforts on configurable, reflective, and adaptive middleware. The industry's approach led to easy deployment, although with a level of flexibility limited by the extent of existing profiles. The approach of the research community, on the other hand, enabled high flexibility, allowing any middleware configuration to be defined. Nevertheless, creating sound configurations using this approach is a challenging task, limiting the target audience to expert engineers. As a consequence, both initiatives do not scale with the current proliferation of specialized application domains. In this paper, we target this problem with an approach that leverages model-driven engineering for the construction of domain-specific middleware platforms. A set of high-level, yet expressive, building blocks is defined in the form of a metamodel, which is used to create models that specify the desired middleware configuration. We argue that this approach enables the rapid development of middleware platforms to match the proliferation of application domains, at the same time as it does not require per-application middleware construction or even highly skilled middleware engineers. We present the current state of our research and discuss research directions to fully realize the approach.},

Second, they select workers only in terms of the requirements defined by the task creator without considering other worker-required factors. To overcome abovementioned limitations, this paper proposes a novel worker selection framework for crowd sensing. Compared to existing work, it mainly has following two characteristics. (1) Multi-scenario. Instead of defining specific factors, we propose a core ontology model to semantically express general factors, based on which task creators can build their own task-specific models efficiently.

abstract = {Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) is defined as a pervasive sensing paradigm where mobile devices gather data with the aim of performing a specific application. The major issues in MCS are the following: mobile devices are characterized by limited resources; scalability issues appear when the number of objects that could be potentially involved in the sensing increases together with the application requests; the MCS sensing tasks should be easily integrated in the variety of IoT applications that in a dynamic way requires the crowd wisdom through MCS tasks. This paper handles the analyzed issues by providing the following contributions. The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm is adopted to address the scalability issues when searching for objects that can potentially take part to the MCS scenarios. Indeed in SIoT a social network is created among objects, which exhibits the typical scalability advantages of social networks when looking for peers in big communities. We integrate the MCS logic into the Lysis platform that implements the SIoT paradigm, making easy for applications developers to activate MCS tasks. We propose a new algorithm to address the resource management issue so that MCS tasks are fairly assigned to the objects, with the objectives of maximizing the lifetime of the task groups. Preliminary experimental results prove that the devices' lifetime values tend to a single value and multiple applications can use the same outcome with improvement in terms of latency and computing resources.},

This paper first provides review of the event-based social networks and the basic principles and architecture of event-based MSNs. Next, event-based MSNs with smartphone contained technology elements, such as context-aware mobility and multimedia sharing, are presented. By combining the feature of context-aware mobility with multimedia sharing in event-based MSNs, event organizers, and planners with the service providers optimize their capability to recognize value for the multimedia services they deliver. The unique features of the current event-based MSNs give rise to the major technology trends to watch for designing applications. These mobile applications and their main features are described. At the end, discussions on the evaluation of the event-based mobile applications based on their main features are presented. Some open research issues and challenges in this important area of research are also outlined.},

Such paradigm is referred as crowdsensing, and lies at the intersection of crowd-sourcing and participatory sensing. This has a wide range of potential applications such as direct involvement of citizens into public decision making. In this work we present Matador, a framework to embed context-awareness in the presentation and execution of crowd-sensing tasks. This allows to present the right tasks, to the right users in the right circumstances, and to preserve normal device functioning.

abstract = {Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global healthcare system. A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},

This city with a population of approximately 6.7 million people came to a standstill. Astonishingly, one of the biggest software development hubs in India was struggling for data and tools to identify which parts of the city were most affected and vulnerable to such climate phenomena. A group of software engineers quickly came up with an idea of using a Flood Map tool managed through crowdsourcing to help the citizens of Chennai and prevent further casualties. They developed a map-based tool called Flooded Streets to report flooded streets using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Using this Flood Map tool, anyone in the crowd could click on a street if they knew it was flooded and update the map information. Within the following 24 hours, over 2,500 streets had been reported as flooded by the citizens of Chennai using the Flood Map tool. An ordinary citizen could zoom into a locality, visualize which streets are reported as flooded and decide their next course of action. This map was also a great aid tool for relief and aid workers to track the flooded paths and provide appropriate aids in that area. The map consists of a base layer of low-lying areas created using elevation models from ISRO and NASA, and flooded areas from UNITAR. The map interactivity was built using Mapbox GL and hosted on GitHub. This crowdsourced sensing system is an extraordinary example of disaster response using the crowdsourcing concept, which potentially helped millions of people with the minimum time and resources but with great crowd contributions from both experts and non-experts.},

abstract = {In this paper we identify basic design issues of Mobile Crowdsensing Systems (MCS) and investigate some characteristic challenges. We define the basic components of an MCS - the Task, the Server and the Crowd - and investigate the functions describing/governing their interactions. We identify three qualitatively different types of Tasks; a) those whose added utility is proportional to the size of the Task, b) those whose added utility is proportional to the progress of the Task and c) those whose added utility is reversely proportional to the progress of the Task. For a given type of Task, and a finite Budget, the Server makes offers to the agents of the Crowd based on some Incentive Policy. On the other hand, each agent that receives an offer decides whether it will undertake the Task or not, based on the inferred cost (computed via a Cost function) and some Join Policy. In their policies, the Crowd and the Server take into account several aspects, such as the number and quality of participating agents, the progress of execution of the Task and possible network effects, present in real-life systems. We evaluate the impact and the performance of selected characteristic policies, for both the Crowd and the Server, in terms of Task execution and Budget efficiency of the Crowd. Experimental findings demonstrate key performance features of the various policies and indicate that some policies are more effective in enabling the Server to efficiently manage its Budget while providing satisfactory incentives to the Crowd and effectively executing the system Tasks. Interestingly, incentive policies that take into account the current crowd participation achieve a better trade-off between Task completion and budget expense.},

abstract = {Mobile social sensing network is one kind of emerging networks in which sensing tasks are performed by mobile users and sensing data are shared and collected by leveraging the intermittent inter-contacts among mobile users. Traditional ad hoc routing protocols are inapplicable or perform poorly for data collection or data sharing in such mobile social networks because nodes are seldom fully connected. In recent years, many routing protocols (especially social-based routing) are proposed to improve the delivery ratio in mobile social networks, but most of them do not consider the load of nodes thus may lead to unbalanced energy consumption among nodes. In this paper, we propose a simple Energy Efficient framework for Social-based Routing (EE-SR) in mobile social sensing networks to balance the load of nodes while maintaining the delivery ratio within an acceptable range by limiting the chances of forwarding in traditional social-based routing. Furthermore, we also propose an improved version of EE-SR to dynamically adjust the controlling parameter. Simulation results on real-life mobile traces demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed framework.},

Since data acquisition is participatory, crowd-sensing systems face the challenge of data trustworthiness and truthfulness assurance in the presence of adversaries whose motivation can be either manipulating sensed data or collaborating unfaithfully with the motivation of maximizing their income. This paper proposes a game theoretic methodology to ensure trustworthiness in user recruitment in mobile crowd-sensing systems. The proposed methodology is a platform-centric framework that consists of three phases: user recruitment, collaborative decision making on trust scores, and badge rewarding. In the proposed framework, users are incentivized by running sub-game perfect equilibrium and gamification techniques. Through simulations, we show that approximately 50{\%} and a minimum of 15{\%} improvement can be achieved by the proposed methodology in terms of platform and user utility, respectively, when compared with fully distributed and user-centric trustworthy crowd-sensing.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the task offloading issue in mobile social networks. Although the "d-choice" paradigm in "ball and bin" theory had shown the power of random choice in load balancing with a random walk model, its performance could be fairly poor where real-trace data sets are concerned. According to our preliminary evaluation results with "MobiClique," the "d-choice" scheme could not achieve well-balanced allocations in a real-trace data set. Nevertheless, it would bring fundamental challenges to task reassignment in the following aspects: First of all, some of the friendships are relatively stable, which would lead to a more imbalanced task assignment, even if the "d-choice" scheme is applied for balancing. Second, some users would meet quite infrequently, which could inevitably lead to intolerable time delay and unfair task allocations. In tackling these difficulties, we revisit the real data sets for exploring the contact property among users. We find that the frequently met users could be leveraged for efficient task execution due to higher task priority. To this end, we propose the "iTop-K" algorithm, leveraging the basic concept, i.e., "your friends are more powerful than you," which encourages mobile users to assign tasks among intimate friends instead of pure random assignment. With careful selections of "Top-K" friends, we achieve balanced load and guaranteed performance at the same time. Experimental studies verify our scheme and show the effectiveness with three typical data trace sets, including "MobiClique." In this typical networking scenario, ours outperforms the conventional random choice scheme up to 15 × and the social relationship assignment without priority method up to 9 ×. Moreover, the "Top-K" scheme could be adaptive, even when no intimate friends are available. By scaling the "K" factor to larger values, our scheme outperforms random assignment and could be inspiringly close to the optimal solution. In summary, ours could effectively explore the social relationship and leverage it for efficient task assignment, which would further encourage more mobile users to work together under the rule of social contacts. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Mobile advertisement distribution effects are vitally important for advertisers as well as users. Status quo studies are lacking of efficient distribution especially when user traces and budgets are involved. In achieving efficient and effective mobile advertisement applications, this work advocates the concept of location-centric mobile crowdsourcing network instead of conventional user-centric and platform, where locations are vitally important for advertisement distribution. To this end, this work focuses on the mobile advertisement user selection problem when interested area coverage (IAC) is considered. Unfortunately, developing location-centric needs to deal with the spatio-temporal features in each user, and IAC coverage needs to be effectively counted. Even worse, budget constraint makes this problem intractable. In tackling aforementioned challenges, this work makes following efforts: First, a budget-constrained user selection problem is formulated when location sensitive mobile advertisement applications are considered, which is proved to be NP-hard.

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an agent-based system running in distributed open environment where agents interact and share information with each other in a community. While performing activities in open system, agent personal information may be disclosed due to several factors such as agent preferences, decisions and behavior. These factors are continuously changing during runtime depending on the activities executed within the system. As a result, there are risks of agent safety such as the disclosures of agent identity and location. Hence, in this research, a solution is proposed to detect agent data confidentiality violations that occur during runtime. The proposed solution includes the definition of data confidentiality as agent quality properties and the violations detection using Runtime Verification and Quality Assessment process. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated by implementing the detection process within Crowdsourced Navigation System model.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing concept has attracted attentions of researchers, developers and businesses in the last decade. This exact concept has also been used in the area of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) mainly for collecting and distributing information about the current traffic condition. In this paper, we extend the mobile crowdsourcing concept to be used for an intelligent car park system. Among several existing applications, the system proposed in this paper has been designed so that it is suitable for the car parking behavior exhibited in asian countries. To be specific, the Pick N Park system was proposed and implemented to gather and deliver real-time information about a number of car parks in crowded urban areas. The proposed system not only assists drivers in planning their journeys; but it also helps alleviate the traffic congestion problem especially in front of the shopping malls (where a line of cars waiting to enter the car park blocks other traffic). In addition to the system, we also propose a car park model that can be used to estimate the congestion level and the search time of each car park. This can be useful especially during the initial phase that the technology is introduced. The model has been evaluated by monte-carlo simulations and the results show that the proposed model can provide excellent search time estimates.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. One of the main concerns for application developers is user satisfaction. Before installing any application from an app market, users first look at the app rating and the number of times it was downloaded. However, ratings are not made by experts, are subjective, and require user involvement; therefore, a large number of reviews are needed before the ratings become statistically reliable. One way to obtain user input transparently is to collect data from devices through crowdsourcing. In this work, we present CrowdApp, a crowdsourcing-based application that continuously runs in the background and collects data from the device without any active user participation (transparent crowdsourcing). Then it computes a score for every app installed on the device. The application was tested on Android. Our results show that there is a high correlation ( {\textgreater}  0.8) between CrowdApp scores and Google Play scores. More importantly, CrowdApp scores also agreed with subjective ratings by the users themselves at the end of the experiment period.},

abstract = {Incentive mechanisms are critical for the success of mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Existing mechanisms mainly focus on scenarios where all sensing tasks are belong to a monopolistic campaign, while ignoring the situation where multiple campaigns coexist and compete for potential sensing capacities. In this paper, we study mechanisms in a two-sided heterogeneous MCS market with multiple requesters and users, where each requester publishes a sensing campaign consisting of various tasks whereas each user can undertake multiple tasks from one or more campaigns. The mechanism design in such a market is very challenging as the demands and supplies are extremely diverse. To fairly and effectively allocate resources and facilitate trades, we propose a novel truthful double auction mechanism named TDMC. By introducing a carefully designed virtual padding requester, a two-stage allocation approach and corresponding pricing schemes for both requesters and users are developed in TDMC. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that TDMC has the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, budget balance, computational tractability, and asymptotic efficiency as the workload supply compared with demand becomes more and more sufficient. To make TDMC more adaptable, we further introduce two more flexible bid profiles for both requesters and users, and two adjustment methods to control the sensing quality. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMC.},

The geographic nature of these tasks distinguishes these markets from online crowdsourcing markets and raises new, fundamental questions. We carried out a controlled study in the Chicago metropolitan area aimed at addressing two key questions: (1) What geographic factors influence whether a crowdworker will be willing to do a task? (2) What geographic factors influence how much compensation a crowdworker will demand in order to do a task? Quantitative modeling shows that travel distance to the location of the task and the socioeconomic status (SES) of the task area are important factors. Qualitative analysis enriches our modeling, with workers mentioning safety and difficulties getting to a location as key considerations. Our results suggest that low-SES areas are currently less able to take advantage of the benefits of mobile crowdsourcing markets. We discuss the implications of our study for these markets, as well as for " sharing economy " phenomena like UberX, which have many properties in common with mobile crowdsourcing markets.},

To explore our concept we implemented a crowd- sourcing platform that integrates location as a parameter for distributing tasks to workers. In the paper we describe the concept and design of the platform and discuss the results of two user studies. Overall the findings show that integrat- ing tasks in the physical world is useful and feasible. We observed that (1) mobile workers prefer to pull tasks rather than getting them pushed, (2) requests for pictures were the most favored tasks, and (3) users tended to solve tasks mainly in close proximity to their homes. Based on this, we discuss issues that should be considered during designing mobile crowdsourcing applications.},

abstract = {Compressive Sensing is a technique that can help reduce the sampling rate of sensing tasks. In mobile crowdsensing applications or wireless sensor networks, the resource burden of collecting samples is often a major concern. Therefore, compressive sensing is a promising approach in such scenarios. An implicit assumption underlying compressive sensing -- both in theory and its applications -- is that every sample has the same cost: its goal is to simply reduce the number of samples while achieving a good recovery accuracy. In many networked sensing systems, however, the cost of obtaining a specific sample may depend highly on the location, time, condition of the device, and many other factors of the sample. In this paper, we study compressive sensing in situations where different samples have different costs, and we seek to find a good trade-off between minimizing the total sample cost and the resulting recovery accuracy. We design Cost-Aware Compressive Sensing (CACS), which incorporates the cost-diversity of samples into the compressive sensing framework, and we apply CACS in networked sensing systems. Technically, we use regularized column sum (RCS) as a predictive metric for recovery accuracy, and use this metric to design an optimization algorithm for finding a least cost randomized sampling scheme with provable recovery bounds. We also show how CACS can be applied in a distributed context. Using traffic monitoring and air pollution as concrete application examples, we evaluate CACS based on large-scale real-life traces. Our results show that CACS achieves significant cost savings, outperforming natural baselines (greedy and random sampling) by up to 4x.},

Unlike current industry practice that relies on workers to manually pick tasks to perform, we automatically make task recommendation based on workers' historical trajectories and desired time budgets. The challenge of predicting workers' trajectories is that it is faced with uncertainties, as a worker does not take same routes every day. In this work, we depart from deterministic modeling and study the stochastic task recommendation problem where each worker is associated with several predicted routine routes with probabilities. We formulate this problem as a stochastic integer linear program whose goal is to maximize the expected total utility achieved by all workers. We further exploit the separable structures of the formulation and apply the Lagrangian relaxation technique to scale up computation. Experiments have been performed over the instances generated using the real Singapore transportation network. The results show that we can find significantly better solutions than the deterministic formulation.},

Generally pre-measured solution can provide high quality data but it needs lots of labor and time. Different from pre-measured solution, crowdsourcing is an economic and efficient way to obtain location information. WFP based on Clustering (WFP-C) in mobile crowdsourcing system is proposed to improve positioning accuracy and reduce computation complexity. WFP-C includes three phases: offline database building, dataset preprocessing and online positioning. In offline database building phase, Android-based APP is developed to collect crowdsourcing data. In dataset preprocessing phase, according to some clustering algorithm, the geography area is divided into several fingerprint clusters which are identified by Position Feature Vectors (PFVs). In online positioning phase, two-stage matching method is proposed. Firstly, the WiFi signal vector is used to match some cluster according to PFVs. And then, the accurate position is calculate using the WiFi signal vector of the cluster. The Android-based APP is installed in smart phones which are carried by ten volunteers. The collected data is used to evaluated our proposal. The experiment compares WFP-C, grid-based WFP and non-cluster WFP. The evaluation results indicate that WFP-C can achieve higher positioning accuracy and low computation complexity.},

abstract = {Nowadays, many cities and communes suffer from advertisements appearing on aesthetically inappropriate or illegal places. This contamination of public space is called visual pollution. The first step in the fight against visual pollution is localization of physical advertising media (e.g., billboards) as accurately as is possible. One of the ways is to use volunteer effort through outdoor crowdsourcing. Smart mobile devices can support this process through localization sensors. However, these sensors are inaccurate enough on their own, plus, the media are not located exactly where the volunteers capture them. Therefore, the media localization is presently inaccurate. This paper presents a work-in-progress method to improve the localization of physical advertisement media. As input, the method takes captured media images along with spatial information about the device. The images are then clustered based on their locations, to form sets corresponding to the true physical media. Then, using visual analysis of the images and spatial orientation of devices, the method computes expected location of the physical media.},

How to incentivize users to participate in such systems while preserving location-privacy is coming up as a critical issue. To this end, we consider location-privacy protection when motivating users to sense data instead of viewing them separately. Without loss of generality, k-anonymity is utilized to reduce the risk of location-privacy disclosure. Specifically, we propose a location aggregation method to cluster users into groups for k-anonymity preserving, and meanwhile mitigating the incurred information loss. After that, an incentive mechanism is carefully designed to select efficient users and calculate rational compensations based on clustered groups obtained in location aggregation, where the influences of both the information loss and k-anonymity in location-privacy preserving are captured into group values and sensing costs. Through theoretical analysis and extensive performances evaluated on real and synthetic data, we find out that the incentive payment increases sharply with more stringent privacy protection and the information loss can be further mitigated compared with conventional methods.},

Many Fog applications such as video mining and event monitoring, rely on data stream processing and analytics, which are very popular in the Cloud, but have not been comprehensively investigated in the context of Fog architecture. In this article, we present the general models and architecture of Fog data streaming, by analyzing the common properties of several typical applications. We also analyze the design space of Fog streaming with the consideration of four essential dimensions (system, data, human, and optimization), where both new design challenges and the issues arise from leveraging existing techniques are investigated, such as Cloud stream processing, computer networks, and mobile computing.},

Mobile crowdsensing systems (MCSs) can be formed by these mobile smart terminals from IoTs to collect and exchange data. The main idea of MCSs is to outsource sensing tasks (collecting data) to various mobile devices which are carried by people or vehicles. The design of incentive mechanisms in MCSs is one of the hottest current research topics. However, most of the existing studies focus on maximizing the utilities or social welfare while neglecting the practical requirements of MCSs surveillance applications.

Nevertheless, privacy preservation and task allocation become main obstacles that need additional attention. To achieve accurate task allocation, it is inevitable to share some sensitive information of mobile users and customers, such as identities, location and points of interest. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing framework (PPMC) for location-based applications to balance the tradeoff between privacy preservation and task allocation. In PPMC, we develop a matrix-based location matching mechanism for the service provider to achieve location-based task allocation without disclosing the location of mobile users and the sensing area of tasks. We also extend BBS+ signature and proxy re-encryption to preserve identity privacy and data privacy for both customers and mobile users under the condition that they are honest to release and perform tasks, respectively. Finally, we discuss security properties and demonstrate the efficiency of PPMC in terms of computational and communication overhead.},

abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm faces the challenges of providing low latency, high availability, and real-time location-aware services where millions of people are mobile with respect to time and geographic location. In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing framework that can support real-time, location-aware personalized services to a very large crowd. The framework uses a hybrid of cloud at the server end and fog computing terminals (FCTs) at the crowd edge. The concept of FCT is realized by adding a middle layer acting as a proxy between the user end and cloud infrastructure. Each FCT node covers a geographic zone and provides a subset of services and resources based on the geographic location of a mobile user. When a user moves from one FCT-covered zone to another, the secure handshaking of metadata about the user is shared with the new FCT node. The communication between mobile users' terminals, such as smartphone and the FCT, is assumed as 4G/5G networks, while the communication between the FCT and cloud is based on a high speed, always available, and reliable Internet connection. The location of each mobile user is made secure and shared according to our novel privacy policy paradigm. The framework is designed to switch between FCT and cloud, depending on the task, network condition, geographic nearness, and resources available within the client unit. We have implemented the framework to support context-aware services to millions of pilgrims that gather together in a very small area of land each year. We will share the inspiring results that we have gathered after initial deployment.},

abstract = {To protect individuals' location privacy, an important privacy protection technique that can be used is k -anonymity, which requires at least k users to participate in an anonymity set, so that any user in the set cannot be distinguished from the other k-1 users. However, a significant part of users may not be concerned about their location privacy and therefore may not be interested in participating in the anonymity set. Hence, a prerequisite for achieving k-anonymity location privacy is to stimulate users to participate. In this paper, we revisit the problem of stimulating users that are privacy-indifferent to participate in the anonymity set and providing k-anonymity location privacy for privacy-sensitive users. We first study the case where all privacy-sensitive users have the same requirement of privacy. Then, we extend our study to a more general setting, where privacy-sensitive users have different requirements. For both cases, we design auction-based mechanisms and rigorously prove that the mechanisms are truthful. More importantly, our mechanisms can achieve higher satisfaction ratio than the existing work, i.e., our mechanisms greatly increase the number of privacy-sensitive users successfully winning the auction and receiving privacy protection. We evaluate our mechanisms by using extensive numerical experiments and simulations on a real-world data set. Evaluation results show that our mechanisms achieve much better performance regarding the satisfaction ratio compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms, and that the computational efficiency is good.},

However, most MCS schemes use a direct mode, in which crowdworkers passively or actively select tasks and contribute without interacting and collaborating with each other; such a mode can hamper some time-constrained crowdsourced tasks. This article explores a different approach: MCS based on word of mouth (WoM), in which crowdworkers, apart from executing tasks, exploit their mobile social networks and/or physical encounters to actively recruit other appropriate individuals to work on the task. The authors describe a WoM-based MCS architecture and typical applications, which they divide into Internet-scale and local scale. They then systematically summarize the main technical challenges, including crowdworker recruitment, incentive design, security and privacy, and data quality control, and they compare typical solutions. Finally, from a systems-level viewpoint, they discuss several practical issues that must be resolved. This article is part of a special issue on cybersecurity.},

Thus, the sustainable people participation is crucial to the development of this sensing paradigm. In this direction, we focus on a central element for the deployment of people-centric sensing applications: guarantee sustainable participation of users. For this, we discuss the existing challenges at the main components of an architecture to support people-centric sensing. In order to enrich this discussion, we also evaluate the incentive mechanisms used by Foursquare, mechanisms that could be used, with proper adaptation, in several types of sensing systems. Among the results, we found evidence that a specific type of incentive (mayorship-based) could be very effective to increase users' engagement. Moreover, we present a set of policies to be incorporated into an existing or new people-centric sensing architecture to complement traditional incentive mechanisms.},

Many papers propose incentive strategies to motivate workers to participate in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we shift the focus from the workers to the job requesters by addressing two of their issues: how to design a good payment scheme to maximize profit and how to select qualified workers to do the job. We use a widely-adopted payment formula consisting of a base salary and extra bonus. We first formulate the problem as an optimization problem and then provide a general solution in which we show that the pay rate can be the same to all the workers. Next we instantiate the solution with a concrete example to derive more concrete results and propose a worker selection algorithm WS. In WS, we not only consider workers' workload demands but also their past working performance to guarantee crowdsourcing quality. Simulation results show that a job requester can pay much less to get the job done in a crowdsourcing environment and our worker selection algorithm is efficient in that it only searches a tiny space to find the solution to the optimization problem. Our effort here provides an evidence to support the benefits of using crowdsourcing in our daily lives.},

abstract = {With the popular development of smart phones and social networks, a large quantity of location-embedded data is collected in mobile cloud. By utilizing these data, the service providers of mobile cloud (MCSP) can provide users with great convenience by location based queries. Thus the mobile cloud service system (MCSS) comes into being. However, the MCSP are untrustworthy, and the location itself contains much privacy information. Hence, the data publishers always encrypt the location information before publishing it. But it brings a great challenge, that how to utilize the encrypted information efficiently. To solve this problem, this paper designs an efficient privacy-preserving processing scheme for location-based queries in mobile cloud. We adapt the RSA algorithm, and combine it with ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) approach. The proposed scheme achieves fine-grained access control over location information, efficient and privacy-preserving location distance computation and comparison. The performance evaluation shows that our scheme is efficient enough to be applied into MCSS.},

abstract = {With increasing development of location-based services (LBSs), location privacy preservation has been one of the most concerned problems. A common method is to let a user generate dummy trajectories, which ensures the location privacy of a lot of users in a small area. However, due to the high cost of generating dummy trajectories, it is not reasonable for only one user to undertake the cost. In this paper, we study the cost sharing problem to determine which user to generate dummy trajectories and receive the payment from the others. We construct an auction based model, where each LBS user as a bidder, reports his privacy cost and dummy trajectories. We propose a cost sharing mechanism, which incentives users to report their true cost and the effective degree of privacy for all the users. We also demonstrate that our mechanism satisfies both incentive compatibility and budget balance. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism via simulated experiments.},

abstract = {Mobile crowd sensing is an emerging sensing paradigm where sensing applications buy sensor data from mobile smartphone users (workers) instead of deploying their own sensor networks to estimate some statistics of a spatial event. In many spatial monitoring applications, the crowdsourcer needs to incentivize smartphone users to contribute sensing data so that the collected dataset has good spatial coverage. To further incentivize privacy-concerned workers to contribute, we propose a Stackelberg incentive framework that allows workers to specify their location privacy requirements while also increasing the spatial coverage of the collected dataset. We then derive a unique Stackelberg equilibrium which demonstrates the stability of our approach. Our simulation results show that our approach is significantly better in terms of data utility than the non-location-aware and uniform-reward approaches.},

But the crowdsourced data from smartphones are generally with low quality, which induce crucial challenges and hurt the applicability of crowdsourcing applications. This paper presents our study to address such challenges in a concrete application, namely floorplan generation. In order to utilize pedestrians' traces for indoor location inference, existing proposals mostly rely on infrastructural references or accurate data sources, which are by nature restricted in terms of applicability and pervasiveness. Our proposal called SenseWit is motivated by the observation that people's behavior offers meaningful clues for location inference. The noise, ambiguity, and behavior diversity contained in the crowdsourced data, however, mean non-trivial challenges in generating high-quality floorplans. We propose 1) a novel concept called Nail to identify featured locations in indoor space and 2) a heuristic pathlet bundling algorithm to progressively discover the internal layouts. We implement SenseWit and conduct real-world experiments in different spaces. Our work offers an efficient technique to obtain high-quality structures (either logical or physical) from low-quality data. We believe it can be generalized to other crowdsourcing applications.},

abstract = {We present mango, a novel low-cost and highly scalable content delivery service for mobile phones. The service is targeted at emerging countries such as India where users are highly price sensitive, and there is considerable demand for rich media content. mango is designed as a content synch-up service. Users install an application (app) on the phone, and through a simple menu select content for download, upload, or sharing. Then, in order to actually transfer content to and from their phones, users visit or opportunistically connect with mango hotspots. The hotspots are short range cells (installed in shops, cafes, or as an app in other users' phones) with a backhaul connection and a wireless interface (such as Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, and down the road femtocells) to communicate with the phones. Given a large number of such low-cost, short range access points, the mango network delivers content to the very edge of the network, within a few feet from the user. Such a content delivery architecture is faster, cheaper, and can support a much larger number of users than macrocellular data networks. In this paper we present the mango service architecture, discuss technical challenges to shorten download times and lower content delivery costs, and outline our plans to develop and deploy this service. We also discuss a variety of interesting applications and services that can be deployed over the core mango system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Alcatel-Lucent.},

This problem is particularly challenging given the redundancy in sensing data, self-interested and strategic user behaviors, and private cost information of smartphones. Most of existing approaches do not consider the important performance objective - maximizing the redundancy-aware data utility of sensing data collected from smartphones. Furthermore, they do not consider the practical constraint on budget. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial auction mechanism based on a reverse auction framework. It consists of an approximation algorithm for winning bids determination and a critical payment scheme. The approximation algorithm guarantees a constant approximation ratio at polynomial-time complexity. The critical payment scheme guarantees truthful bidding. The rigid theoretical analysis demonstrates that our mechanism achieves truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, and budget feasibility. Extensive simulations show that the proposed mechanism produces high redundancy-aware data utility.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing systems are important sources of information for the Internet of Things (IoT) such as gathering location related sensing data for various applications by employing ordinary citizens to participate in data collection. In order to improve the Quality of Information (QoI) of the collected data, the system server needs to coordinate participants with different data collection capabilities and various incentive requirements. However, existing participant coordination methods require the participants to reveal their trajectories to the system server which causes privacy leakage. But, with the improvement of ordinary citizens' consciousness to protect their rights, the risk of privacy leakage may reduce their enthusiasm for data collection. In this paper, we propose a participant coordination framework, which allows the system server to provide optimal QoI for sensing tasks without knowing the trajectories of participants. The participants work cooperatively to coordinate their sensing tasks instead of relying on the traditional centralized server. A cooperative data aggregation, an incentive distribution method, and a punishment mechanism are further proposed to both protect participant privacy and ensure the QoI of the collected data. Simulation results show that our proposed method can efficiently select appropriate participants to achieve better QoI than other methods, and can protect each participant's privacy effectively.},

abstract = {Participatory smartphone sensing has lately become more and more popular as a new paradigm for performing large-scale sensing, in which each smartphone contributes its sensed data for a collaborative sensing application. Most existing studies consider that smartphone users are strictly strategic and completely rational, which try to maximize their own payoffs. A number of incentive mechanisms are designed to encourage smartphone users to participate, which can achieve only suboptimal system performance. However, few existing studies can maximize a system-wide objective which takes both the platform and smartphone users into account. This paper focuses on the crucial problem of maximizing the system-wide performance or social welfare for a participatory smartphone sensing system. There are two great challenges. First, the social welfare maximization cannot be realized on the platform side because the cost of each user is private and unknown to the platform in reality. Second, the participatory sensing system is a large-scale real-time system due to the huge number of smartphone users who are geo-distributed in the whole world. A price-based decomposition framework is proposed in our previous work (Liu and Zhu, 2013), in which the platform provides a unit price for the sensing time spent by each user and the users return the sensing time via maximizing the monetary reward. This pricing framework is an effective incentive mechanism as users are motivated to participate for monetary rewards from the platform. In this paper, we propose two distributed solutions, which protect users' privacy and achieve optimal social welfare. The first solution is designed based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition. A poplar iterative gradient algorithm is used to converge to the optimal value. Moreover, this distributed method is interpreted by our pricing framework. In the second solution, we first equivalently convert the original problem to an optimal pricing problem. Then, a distributed solution under the pricing framework via an efficient price-updating algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show that both two distributed solutions can achieve the maximum social welfare of a participatory smartphone system.},

abstract = {Opportunistic networks are a special case of DTNs that exploit systematically the mobility of nodes. When node contacts occur, routing protocols can exploit them to forward messages. In the absence of stable end-to-end paths, spatio-temporal paths are created spontaneously. Opportunistic networks are suitable for communications in pervasive environments that are saturated by other devices. The ability to self-organize using the local interactions among nodes, added to mobility, leads to a shift from legacy packet-based communications towards a message-based communication paradigm. Usually, routing is done by means of message replication in order to increase the probability of message delivery. Instead, we study the use of Temporal Random Walks (TRWs) on opportunistic networks as a simple method to deliver messages. TRW can adapt itself to the self-organizing evolution of opportunistic networks. A TRW can be seen as the passing of a token among nodes on the spatio-temporal paths. Since the token passing is an atomic operation, we can see it as forwarding one simple message among nodes. We study the drop ratio for message forwarding considering finite buffers. We then explore the idea of token-sharing as a routing mechanism. Instead of using contacts as mere opportunities to transfer messages, we use them to forward the token over time. The evolution of the token is ruled by the TRW process. Finally, we use the TRW to monitor opportunistic networks. We present the limits and convergence of monitoring the interact time between participating nodes.},

abstract = {This paper presents one emerging social-technical innovation: The evolution of citizen-sensor-networks where citizens organize themselves from the ‘bottom up', for the sake of confronting governance officials with measured information about environmental qualities. We have observed how citizen-sensor-networks have been initiated in the Netherlands in cases where official government monitoring and business organizations leave gaps. The formed citizen-sensor-networks collect information about issues that affect the local community in their quality-of-living. In particular, two community initiatives are described where the sensed environmental information, on noise pollution and gas-extraction induced earthquakes respectively, is published through networked geographic information methods. Both community initiatives pioneered in developing an approach that comprises the combined setting-up of sensor data flows, real-time map portals and community organization. Two particular cases are analyzed to trace the emergence and network operation of such ‘networked geo-information tools' in practice: (1) The Groningen earthquake monitor, and (2) The Airplane Monitor Schiphol. In both cases, environmental ‘externalities' of spatial-economic activities play an important role, having economic dimensions of national importance (e.g. gas extraction and national airport development) while simultaneously affecting the regional community with environmental consequences. The monitoring systems analyzed in this paper are established bottom-up, by citizens for citizens, to serve as ‘information power' in dialogue with government institutions. The goal of this paper is to gain insight in how these citizen-sensor-networks come about: how the idea for establishing a sensor network originated, how their value gets recognized and adopted in the overall ‘system of governance'; to what extent they bring countervailing power against vested interests and established discourses to the table and influence power-laden conflicts over environmental pressures; and whether or not they achieve (some form of) institutionalization and, ultimately, policy change. We find that the studied-citizen-sensor networks gain strength by uniting efforts and activities in crowdsourcing data, providing factual, ‘objectivized data' or ‘evidence' of the situation ‘on the ground' on a matter of local community-wide concern. By filling an information need of the local community, a process of ‘collective sense-making' combined with citizen empowerment could grow, which influenced societal discourse and challenged prevailing truth-claims of public institutions. In both cases similar, ‘competing' web-portals were developed in response, both by the gas-extraction company and the airport. But with the citizen-sensor-networks alongside, we conclude there is a shift in power balance involved between government and affected communities, as the government no longer has information monopoly on environmental measurements.},

abstract = {The amount of social events has increased significantly and location-based services have become an integral part of our life. This makes the recommendation of activity sequences an important emerging application. Recently, the notion of a distributed event (e.g. festival or cruise) that gathers multiple competitive activities has appeared in the literature. An attendee of such events is overwhelmed with numerous possible activities and faces the problem of activity selection with the goal to maximise satisfaction of experience. This selection is subject to various uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate the problem of recommendation of activity sequences as a combination of personalised event recommendation and scheduling problem. We present a new integrated framework to solve it and two computation strategies to analyse the categorical, temporal and textual users' interests. We mine the users' historical traces to extract their behavioural patterns and use them in the construction of the itinerary. The evaluation of our approach on a dataset built over a cruise program shows an average improvement of 9.7{\%} over the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Humanitarian assistance has been on the global conscience for approximately 70 years (since WWII), and yet in 2010 2.4 billion people still lived on less than {\$}2 per day. As Easterly has pointed out: to see where we went wrong, just look at the incentives. To create true sustainable economic change requires realignment of incentives, particularly the incentive to work and invest. Employment is fundamentally required, and crowd work is the current best hope for providing that employment quickly, with global reach, and at scale. This approach is grassroots, bottom-up, and puts the income directly in the hands of people who need it. Further, it leverages the natural, inherent incentives embodied in capitalism (workers work to create value and get paid, employers want to minimize costs of labor) to shift as much work as possible to the places where it will have the most beneficial impact. We present an analysis of global trends supporting crowdsourcing as a solution, and the results of a pilot project in a rural Kenyan village which demonstrates that this approach is an extremely promising way to meet basic needs to promote economic growth.},

This framework does so by preferentially targeting contributors who are likely to offer quality content. We evaluate our framework on Flickr data for the entire city of Barcelona and show that it ensures high levels of task quality and wide geographic coverage, all without compromising fairness.},

abstract = {We present a prototype mobile phone application that implements a novel transportation mode detection algorithm. The application is designed to run in the background, and continuously collects data from built-in acceleration and network location sensors. The collected data is analyzed automatically and partitioned into activity segments. A key finding of our work is that walking activity can be robustly detected in the data stream, which, in turn, acts as a separator for partitioning the data stream into other activity segments. Each vehicle activity segment is then sub-classified according to the vehicle type. Our approach yields high accuracy despite the low sampling interval and does not require GPS data. As a result, device power consumption is effectively minimized. This is a very crucial point for large-scale real-world deployment. As part of an experiment, the application has been used by 495 samples, and our prototype provides 82{\%} accuracy in transportation mode classification for an experiment performed in Zurich, Switzerland. Incorporating location type information with this activity classification technology has the potential to impact many phenomena driven by human mobility and to enhance awareness of behavior, urban planning, and agent-based modeling.},

abstract = {Gamification has drawn the attention of academics, practitioners and business professionals in domains as diverse as education, information studies, human-computer interaction, and health. As yet, the term remains mired in diverse meanings and contradictory uses, while the concept faces division on its academic worth, underdeveloped theoretical foundations, and a dearth of standardized guidelines for application. Despite widespread commentary on its merits and shortcomings, little empirical work has sought to validate gamification as a meaningful concept and provide evidence of its effectiveness as a tool for motivating and engaging users in non-entertainment contexts. Moreover, no work to date has surveyed gamification as a field of study from a human-computer studies perspective. In this paper, we present a systematic survey on the use of gamification in published theoretical reviews and research papers involving interactive systems and human participants. We outline current theoretical understandings of gamification and draw comparisons to related approaches, including alternate reality games (ARGs), games with a purpose (GWAPs), and gameful design. We present a multidisciplinary review of gamification in action, focusing on empirical findings related to purpose and context, design of systems, approaches and techniques, and user impact. Findings from the survey show that a standard conceptualization of gamification is emerging against a growing backdrop of empirical participants-based research. However, definitional subjectivity, diverse or unstated theoretical foundations, incongruities among empirical findings, and inadequate experimental design remain matters of concern. We discuss how gamification may to be more usefully presented as a subset of a larger effort to improve the user experience of interactive systems through gameful design. We end by suggesting points of departure for continued empirical investigations of gamified practice and its effects.},

abstract = {Incentive is crucial to the success of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems. Over the different manners of incentives, providing monetary rewards has been proved quite useful. However, existing monetary-based incentive studies (e.g., the reverse auction based methods) mainly encourage user participation, whereas sensing quality is often neglected. First, the budget setting is static and may not meet the sensing contexts or user anticipation. Second, they do not measure the quality of data contributed. Third, the design of most incentive schemes is quantity- or cost-focused and not quality-oriented. To address these issues, we propose a novel MCS incentive mechanism called TaskMe. An LBSN (location-based social network)-powered model is leveraged for dynamic budgeting and proper worker selection, and a combination of multi-facet quality measurements and a multi-payment-enhanced reverse auction scheme are used to improve sensing quality. Experiments on several user studies and the crawled dataset validate TaskMe's effectiveness.},

Population-distributed models are presented with master-slave, island, cellular, hierarchical, and pool architectures, which parallelize an evolution task at population, individual, or operation levels. Dimension-distributed models include coevolution and multi-agent models, which focus on dimension reduction. Insights into the models, such as synchronization, homogeneity, communication, topology, speedup, advantages and disadvantages are also presented and discussed. The study of these models helps guide future development of different and/or improved algorithms. Also highlighted are recent hotspots in this area, including the cloud and MapReduce-based implementations, GPU and CUDA-based implementations, distributed evolutionary multiobjective optimization, and real-world applications. Further, a number of future research directions have been discussed, with a conclusion that the development of distributed evolutionary computation will continue to flourish.},

This can be likened to a coordination game with multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria. Through a series of experiments, we study consumers' ability to coordinate on purchasing the network good. Our results highlight the central importance of the size of the critical mass. Neither an improved reward-risk ratio through lower prices nor previous success at a lower critical mass facilitates the establishment of a network market when the critical mass is sufficiently high.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly pervasive and are transforming information distribution paradigms. A rapidly growing segment of urban public transport passengers carry mobile computing devices, permanently and on the move. In a context of thinning financial resources, getting customers involved in the actual delivery of a public transport service as real-time information consumers and providers, may be a powerful method to enhance travel experience while reducing operational costs for the service operator. Each and every customer travelling on a public transport network has unique knowledge about the service operation as it unfolds. This paper proposes a framework that aims to unify public transport passengers' collective intelligence through crowdsourcing, using their mobile computing devices and dedicated web services. It strives to intensify win-win relationships between public transport passengers and operators. The structured exchange of information is sustained by a validation mechanism for data reliability, and an incentive mechanism to encourage passenger participation. Passengers benefit from rich real-time data tailored to their profiles, to ease their journeys and improve travel experience, in exchange for their own participation providing and validating information. Operators gain access to rich customer generated data, which in an aggregated format may provide a real-time assessment of customer experience and of local performance across the entire network operation. Operators may be required to reward travellers who become prolific co-creators of the public transport service, but higher customer experience levels, lesser needs for investment in controlling mechanisms, and continuous free monitoring of customer opinions can jointly lead to financial returns.},

abstract = {Background: Emergency management (EM) refers to the ability to deal with emergency tasks in different phases and iterations. To do this, each task requires many and different types of information coming from several sources related to the incident. As people working in an emergency situation are generally under stress and have to make quick and effective decisions, they need to assimilate the received information in an easy and intuitive way. Information visualization (InfoVis) is the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition to understand these data through 2D computer screens. It is frequently used to analyze and understand the huge amount of multidimensional data produced in an emergency. Objective: This study analyzes how researchers use information visualization tools to improve emergency management. Our general objective is to map the area examining both the scientific community and the contributions that have been published in the literature, aiming to provide information, such as: understanding how the area is structured, common practices in existing works, and research gaps. Methods: A systematic mapping study was conducted to analyze the available information visualization tools and their applications in EM activities. A thorough search was carried out and a formal selection process was applied to gather all relevant articles on the subject. Selected primary studies were classified and analyzed with respect to their metadata and to answer eight research questions related to our mapping goal. In total, 196 studies were analyzed in depth. Results: The mapping study identified the most common visualization techniques applied in emergency management, the common environments and phases where they are applied, identifying gaps and also possible trends in the subject. We found out that particular issues concerning emergency management are not fully covered by existing visualization approaches, and when covered, existing literature provides only partial solutions. Conclusion: Our results provide a deep analysis on the application of InfoVis in the EM area, supporting researchers and developers in EM systems with insightful information on trending techniques in use, command practices and existing research gaps. We expect that these findings can support them on proposing new approaches to solve open problems in the area.},

abstract = {Users can enjoy personalized services provided by various context-aware applications that collect users' contexts through sensor-equipped smartphones. Meanwhile, serious privacy concerns arise due to the lack of privacy preservation mechanisms. Currently, most mechanisms apply passive defense policies in which the released contexts from a privacy preservation system are always real, leading to a great probability with which an adversary infers the hidden sensitive contexts about the users. In this paper, we apply a deception policy for privacy preservation and present a novel technique, FakeMask, in which fake contexts may be released to provably preserve users' privacy. The output sequence of contexts by FakeMask can be accessed by the untrusted context-aware applications or be used to answer queries from those applications. Since the output contexts may be different from the original contexts, an adversary has greater difficulty in inferring the real contexts. Therefore, FakeMask limits what adversaries can learn from the output sequence of contexts about the user being in sensitive contexts, even if the adversaries are powerful enough to have the knowledge about the system and the temporal correlations among the contexts. The essence of FakeMask is a privacy checking algorithm which decides whether to release a fake context for the current context of the user. We present a novel privacy checking algorithm and an efficient one to accelerate the privacy checking process. Extensive evaluation experiments on real smartphone context traces of users demonstrate the improved performance of FakeMask over other approaches. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Many applications in this domain require Device-to-Device (D2D) communications between participating devices for interactive operations such as task collaborations and file transmissions. Considering the private participating devices and their opportunistic encountering behaviors, it is highly desired to establish secure and trustworthy D2D connections in a fast and autonomous way, which is vital for implementing practical Mobile Crowdsourcing Systems (MCSs). In this paper, we develop an efficient scheme, Trustworthy Device Pairing (TDP), which achieves user-transparent secure D2D connections and reliable peer device selections for trustworthy D2D communications. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security intensity of TDP in theory. The performance of TDP is evaluated based on both real-world prototype experiments and extensive trace-driven simulations. Evaluation results verify our theoretical analysis and show that TDP significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of pairing speed, stability, and security.},

abstract = {Most research on incentive mechanism design in crowdsourcing has focused on how to allocate sensing tasks to participants to maximize the social welfare. However, none of them consider the coverage holes created by the uneven distribution of participants. As a result, most participants in some popular areas compete for tasks, while many tasks in unpopular areas cannot be completed due to the lack of participants. In this paper, we design a movement-based incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing, where participants are stimulated to move to the unpopular areas and complete the sensing tasks in these areas, which benefits both participants and the platform. We formulate a task allocation problem considering controlled mobility. Since the task allocation problem is NP-hard, we propose a greedy algorithm to solve it, and design a critical payment policy to guarantee that participants declare their cost truthfully. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed incentive mechanism satisfies the desired properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, platform profitability, and computational efficiency. Evaluation results show that the proposed movementbased incentive mechanism outperforms existing solution under various conditions.},

In order to stabilize the mobile crowdsourcing at a massive scale, incentive mechanisms are needed not only to stimulate the users of mobile phones to participate in sensing, but also to incentivize the organizer of the sensing tasks with maximum service time and payoff. In this paper, we study a practical problem in mobile sensing, i.e., sensing time uncertainty, which may lead to failures of existing incentive mechanisms. In particular, we model this problem as a perturbed Stackelberg game in which mobile phone users may actually conduct sensing tasks during different periods of time rather than what they intend, like through a trembling hand. We find that there exist Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibria (THP) given proper rewards. After characterizing THPs in this game with rigorous analysis, we design incentive mechanisms that can achieve a THP with the maximum system wide total sensing time and maximum platform utility. We finally verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed incentive mechanisms and algorithms through extensive experiments.},

One key feature of supporting a pleasant/excellent service is the access to adequate and comprehensive data, which can be obtained by mobile crowdsourcing. The main challenge in crowdsourcing is how the service provider (principal) incentivizes a large group of mobile users to participate. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing a crowdsourcing tournament to maximize the principal's utility in crowdsourcing and provide continuous incentives for users by rewarding them based on the rank achieved. First, we model the user's utility of reward from achieving one of the winning ranks in the tournament. Then, the utility maximization problem of the principal is formulated, under the constraint that the user maximizes its own utility by choosing the optimal effort in the crowdsourcing tournament. Finally, we present numerical results to show the parameters' impact on the tournament design and compare the system performance under the different proposed incentive mechanisms. We show that by using the tournament, the principal successfully maximizes the utilities, and users obtain the continuous incentives to participate in the crowdsourcing activity.},

abstract = {People-centric sensing with smart phones can be used for large scale sensing of the physical world by leveraging the cameras, microphones, GPSs, accelerometers, and other sensors on the phones. Ranging from manual photo tasks to automated sensing tasks for activity monitoring, any task can be crowd sourced to smart phones to sense data from different locations at reduced cost. However, the sensed data submitted by participants is not always reliable as they can submit false data to earn money without executing the actual task. Therefore, it is important to validate the sensed data. Validating the context of every sensed data point of each participant is not a scalable solution. One alternative is to first validate the location associated with the sensed data points in order to achieve a certain degree of reliability about the sensed data. However, location validation without support from the wireless carriers is difficult. To address this problem, we propose ILR, a scheme in which we Improve the Location Reliability of mobile crowd sensed data with minimal human efforts. In this scheme, we bootstrap the trust in the system by first manually or automatically using image processing techniques validating a small number of photos submitted by participants. Based on these validations, the location of these photos is assumed to be trusted. Second, we extend this location trust to co-located sensed data points found in the Bluetooth range of the devices that provided the validated photos. This transitive trust is extended until all the co-located tasks are trusted or no new data points are found. In addition, the scheme also helps to detect false location claims associated with sensed data. We applied ILR on data collected from our McSense prototype deployed on Android phones used by students on our campus and detected a significant percentage of the malicious users. Simulation results demonstrate that ILR works well at various densities and helps detect the false locatio- claims based on a minimal numher of validations.},

Mobile crowdsourcing, crowdsensing, crowd-steering, participatory social systems, mobile device clouds, and cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems are examples. This talk will explore several ideas in crowd-powered mobile computing, including crowd machines, scalable context-awareness, extreme cooperation, and drone services for mobile crowds.},

Thus, the development of solutions that make the organization and use of urban space more efficient is highly necessary. From this need arises the concept of Smart Cities. Upon searching for applications that embodied the Smart Cities concept in the context of reporting issues in public spaces, a new application was developed. GO! Cidade is an innovative application for iOS which uses the power of mobile crowdsourcing to enable collaborative mapping of the problems in public spaces such as parks, streets or roads. To verify its effectiveness, this application was tested for two months by four people in the city of Aracaju-SE, Brazil.},

abstract = {Mobile crowd-sourcing can become as a strategy to perform time-sensitive urban tasks (such as municipal monitoring and last mile logistics) by effectively coordinating smartphone users. The success of the mobile crowd-sourcing platform depends mainly on its effectiveness in engaging crowd-workers, and recent studies have shown that compared to the pull-based approach, which relies on crowd-workers to browse and commit to tasks they would want to perform, the push-based approach can take into consideration of worker's daily routine, and generate highly effective recommendations. As a result, workers waste less time on detours, plan more in advance, and require much less planning effort. However, the push-based systems are not without drawbacks. The major concern is the potential privacy invasion that could result from the disclosure of individual's mobility traces to the crowd-sourcing platform. In this paper, we first demonstrate specific threats of continuous sharing of users locations in such push-based crowd-sourcing platforms. We then propose a simple yet effective location perturbation technique that obfuscates certain user locations to achieve privacy guarantees while not affecting the quality of the recommendations the system generates.We use the mobility traces data we obtained from our urban campus to show the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and the quality of the recommendations associated with the proposed solution. We show that obfuscating even 75{\%} of the individual trajectories will affect the user to make another extra 1.8 minutes of detour while gaining 62.5{\%} more uncertainty of his location traces.},

In this work, we consider the sensor selection problem in a general time-dependent and location-aware participatory sensing system, taking the long-term user participation incentive into explicit consideration. We study the problem systematically under different information scenarios, regarding both future information and current information (realization). In particular, we propose a Lyapunov-based VCG auction policy for the on-line sensor selection, which converges asymptotically to the optimal off-line benchmark performance, even with no future information and under asymmetry of current information. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed policy outperforms the state-of-art policies in the literature, in terms of both user participation (e.g., reducing the user dropping probability by 25{\%} {\~{}} 90{\%}) and social performance (e.g., increasing the social welfare by 15{\%} {\~{}} 80{\%}).},

abstract = {This article surveys recent literature on Vehicular Social Networks that are a particular class of vehicular ad hoc networks, characterized by social aspects and features. Starting from this pillar, we investigate perspectives of next generation vehicles under the assumption of social networking for vehicular applications (i.e., safety and entertainment applications). This paper plays a role as a starting point about socially-inspired vehicles, and main related applications, as well as communication techniques. Vehicular communications can be considered as the “first social network for automobiles”, since each driver can share data with other neighbors. As an instance, heavy traffic is a common occurrence in some areas on the roads (e.g., at intersections, taxi loading/unloading areas, and so on); as a consequence, roads become a popular social place for vehicles to connect to each other. Human factors are then involved in vehicular ad hoc networks, not only due to the safety related applications, but also for entertainment purpose. Social characteristics and human behavior largely impact on vehicular ad hoc networks, and this arises to the vehicular social networks, which are formed when vehicles (individuals) “socialize” and share common interests. In this paper, we provide a survey on main features of vehicular social networks, from novel emerging technologies to social aspects used for mobile applications, as well as main issues and challenges. Vehicular social networks are described as decentralized opportunistic communication networks formed among vehicles. They exploit mobility aspects, and basics of traditional social networks, in order to create novel approaches of message exchange through the detection of dynamic social structures. An overview of the main state-of-the-art on safety and entertainment applications relying on social networking solutions is also provided.},

Considerable amount of works has extensively studied to analyze the influence in social networks, but most of the existing works unfortunately neglected the fact that the location information in the cyber-physical world could also play an important role in the influence prorogation. Furthermore, even though a few works consider a little location information to enhance the influence maximization, they do not discuss any privacy issue of the model and expose user's location information directly to the public. This paper considers the problem of influence maximization in both GPS-enabled cyber-physical and online social networks with privacy reservation. We propose one novel model merging both GPS data of cyber-physical network and relationship data of online social network together in a unified framework, then we provide an efficient algorithm to solve the influence maximization problem in the framework. Besides the influence maximization problem, our framework could also support other applications involving both cyber-physical and online social networks. Further more, to protect the sensitive location and link information, we also provide corresponding techniques to protect the privacy during the whole influence maximization process. Empirical studies of real life datasets demonstrate the power of engaging location information to influence maximization, and suggest that our resolution outperforming most existing alternative algorithms with the protection of location privacy. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {In mobile crowdsourcing systems, smartphones can collectively monitor the surrounding environment and share data with the platform of the system. The platform manages the system and encourages smartphone users to contribute to the crowdsourcing system. To enable such sensing system, incentive mechanisms are necessary to motivate users to share the sensing capabilities of their smartphones. In this paper, we propose ProMoT, which is a Profit Maximizing Truthful auction mechanism for mobile crowdsourcing systems. In the proposed auction mechanism, the platform acts as an auctioneer. The smartphone users act as the sellers and submit their bids to the platform. The platform selects a subset of smartphone users and assigns the tasks to them. ProMoT aims to maximize the profit of the platform while providing satisfying rewards to the smartphone users. ProMoT consists of a winner determination algorithm, which is an approximate but close-to-optimal algorithm based on a greedy mechanism, and a payment scheme, which determines the payment to users. Both are computationally efficient with polynomial time complexity. We prove that ProMoT motivates smartphone users to rationally participate and truthfully reveals their bids. Simulation results show that ProMoT increases the profit of the platform in comparison with an existing scheme.},

abstract = {Clock synchronization is highly desirable in distributed systems, including many applications in the Internet of Things and Humans (IoTH). It improves the efficiency, modularity and scalability of the system, and optimizes use of event triggers. For IoTH, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) - a subset of the recent Bluetooth v4.0 stack - provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets) carried by humans. This fundamental design paradigm of BLE is enabled by a range of broadcast advertising modes. While its operational benefits are numerous, the lack of a common time reference in the broadcast mode of BLE has been a fundamental limitation. This paper presents and describes CheepSync: a time synchronization service for BLE advertisers, especially tailored for applications requiring high time precision on resource constrained BLE platforms. Designed on top of the existing Bluetooth v4.0 standard, the CheepSync framework utilizes low-level timestamping and comprehensive error compensation mechanisms for overcoming uncertainties in message transmission, clock drift and other system specific constraints. CheepSync was implemented on custom designed nRF24Cheep beacon platforms (as broadcasters) and commercial off-the-shelf Android ported smartphones (as passive listeners). We demonstrate the efficacy of CheepSync by numerous empirical evaluations in a variety of experimental setups, and show that its average (single-hop) time synchronization accuracy is in the 10us range.},

abstract = {Crowdsensing leverages the pervasiveness and power of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to enable ordinary citizens to collect, transport and verify data. Application domains range from environment monitoring, to infrastructure management and social computing. Crowdsensing services' effectiveness is a direct result of their coverage, which is driven by the recruitment and mobility patterns of participants. Due to the typically uneven population distributions of most areas, and the regular mobility patterns of participants, less popular or populated areas suffer from poor coverage. In this paper, we present Crowd Soft Control (CSC), an approach to exert limited control over the actions of participants by leveraging the built-in incentives of location-based gaming and social applications. By pairing crowdsensing with location-based applications, CSC allows sensing services to reuse the incentives of location-based apps to steer the actions of participating users and increase the effectiveness of sensing campaigns. While there are several domains where this intentional movement is useful such as data muling, this paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of CSC applied to crowdsensing. We built a prototype of CSC and integrated it with two location-based applications, and crowdsensing services. Our experimental results demonstrate the low-cost of integration and minimal overhead of CSC.},

abstract = {Location based services have experienced an explosive growth and evolved from utilizing a single location to the whole trajectory. Due to the hardware and energy constraints, there are usually many missing data within a trajectory. In order to accurately recover the complete trajectory, crowdsensing provides a promising method. This method resorts to the correlation among multiple users' trajectories and the advanced compressive sensing technique, which significantly outperforms conventional interpolation methods on accuracy. However, as trajectories exposes users' daily activities, the privacy issue is a major concern in crowdsensing. While existing solutions independently tackle the accurate trajectory recovery and privacy issues, yet no single design is able to address these two challenges simultaneously. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel Privacy Preserving Compressive Sensing (PPCS) scheme, which encrypts a trajectory with several other trajectories while maintaining the homomorphic obfuscation property for compressive sensing. Under PPCS, adversaries can only capture the encrypted data, so the user privacy is preserved. Furthermore, the homomorphic obfuscation property guarantees that the recovery accuracy of PPCS is comparable to the state-of-the-art compressive sensing design. Based on two publicly available traces with numerous users and long durations, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate PPCS. The results demonstrate that PPCS achieves a high accuracy of {\textless};53 m and a large distortion between the encrypted and the original trajectories (a commonly adopted metric of privacy strength) of {\textgreater}9,000 m even when up to 50{\%} original data are missing.},

abstract = {Stimulating participation from smartphone users is of paramount importance to mobile crowd sourcing systems and applications. A few incentive mechanisms have been proposed, but most of them have made the impractical assumption that smartphones remain static in the system and sensing tasks are known in advance. The existing mechanisms fail when being applied to the realistic scenario where smartphones dynamically arrive to the system and sensing tasks are submitted at random. It is particularly challenging to design an incentive mechanism for such a mobile crowd sourcing system, given dynamic smartphones, uncertain arrivals of tasks, strategic behaviors, and private information of smartphones. We propose two truthful auction mechanisms for two different cases of mobile crowd sourcing with dynamic smartphones. For the offline case, we design an optimal truthful mechanism with an optimal task allocation algorithm of polynomial-time computation complexity of O (n+$\gamma$)3, where n is the number of smartphones and $\gamma$ is the number of sensing tasks. For the online case, we design a near-optimal truthful mechanism with an online task allocation algorithm that achieves a constant competitive ratio of 1:2. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations have been performed, and the results demonstrate the proposed auction mechanisms achieve truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, and low overpayment.},

abstract = {The need to shift from traditional teaching perspective to novel learning paradigms, mobile computing and experiential coursework is nowadays so relevant that both educators, curriculum designers and institutions must cope with these innovations, by progressively absorbing them into their programs. In such a scenario, we firmly believe that the actual pervasivity of mobile devices amongst learners can be exploited profitably to enrich and diversify didactic offerings, as well as the ways students participate and learn. More specifically, we identified the so-called Mobile Crowd-Sensing (MCS) paradigm as a viable candidate to introduce students from high schools to pivotal topics in engineering, Information Technology (IT) and entrepreneurship. Indeed, according to this paradigm, numerous physical quantities can be measured directly via mobile-embedded sensors (e.g., accelerometers, microphones, gyroscopes), thus increasing the contextual awareness of their owners without requiring expensive measurement equipment. In this paper, we propose our experience in Southern Italy by describing a project for introducing MCS into pilot schools and local communities. Achievable pedagogical advantages, enabling technologies, institution involvement and expected field trials are examined in details as well.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Mobile Learning (M-Learning) has gained considerable popularity among the learners. Accessibility and compatibility of M-Learning application is no more restricted to limited number of mobile devices. Now M-Learning providers have given freedom of learning on any mobile device owned by the user in the environment called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). However, the major problem exists when it comes to development and testing of such kind of application, which would run on variety of mobile platforms and under the geographically diverse environment. The testing process carried out by the development team in such a diverse environment and on variety of mobile platforms is not economical both in terms of cost and time. Hence this article proposes a solution in the form of Crowd sourced testing to overcome the M-Learning application testing problem. Crowd sourced testing would be conducted by the end users while using the application on their own devices. The users would report issues related to installation, downloading and updating, GUI etc. to a feedback repository. A Software test engineer analyzes the issues for relevancy and forward to Software developer if found appropriate. The Software developer would solve the issue by either customizing the application according to the particular device and platforms or make necessary changes to suite all the available devices and platforms This approach is limited to the basic functionality and usage problem which could be easily identified by the application users. Testing of M-Learning application related to performance, load and stress etc. which needs technical resources and expertise would be conducted using approaches such as Cloud based testing, testing on Emulators etc. by Software test engineer himself. The proposed approach still needs validation in real user's environment.},

abstract = {In many existing incentive-based mobile sensing applications, the sensing job owner runs an auction with the mobile phone users to maximize its purchased sensing resource. We notice that both the mobile phone users and the job owner could behave dishonestly to pursue their own interests. This motivates us to design secure and dependable auction mechanisms that generate the correct, promising output even when both of them could cheat. In particular, in this paper, we consider a general auction in which a buyer, who acts as the auctioneer, purchases the resource under a limited budget from a group of sellers who act as the bidders. Considering bidders' privacy and their limited computing capacity, we construct our mechanisms by integrating the innovative game theoretical techniques, logic deductions, and efficient cryptographic operations. Our mechanisms are not only proved to be strategy-proof against dishonest bidders in the sense that they are incentivized to bid their private types truthfully, but also enable all the bidders to efficiently verify the correctness of the auction's outcome, that is computed by the auctioneer, without revealing their private types to each other. Meanwhile, our mechanisms are proved to have the theoretical guarantee that the auctioneer/buyer's expected revenue (i.e. the amount of service it acquires after the auction) is no less than a certain portion of the optimal revenue that the auctioneer can acquire when it knows all the bidders' types at no cost. Our extensive evaluations show that our mechanisms achieve good performance in terms of the revenue maximization and their efficiency.},

abstract = {Mobile devices with sensing capabilities have enabled a new paradigm of mobile crowdsensing with a broad range of applications. A major challenge in achieving a stable crowdsensing system in a large scale is the incentive issue for each participant. Proper incentive mechanisms are necessary to keep the crowdsensing working. However, most existing incentive mechanisms for crowdsensing assume the system has infinite precisions in opposite of the fact that digital devices round the results to discrete floating numbers. In this paper, we show that finite precisions and rounding can make the existing crowdsensing incentive mechanisms invalid. To address this problem, we design an incentive mechanism for discrete crowdsensing that achieves Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) and maximizes platform utility. Our mechanism is efficient since its computational complexity is linear to the number of users. We also consider the case that different participants have diverse precisions, and design another incentive mechanism to achieve mixed PBE and maximize platform utility in the statistical sense. Extensive simulations verify our mechanisms are efficient, individual-rational and system-optimal.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing is deemed as a powerful technique to solve traditional problems. But the crowdsourced data from smartphones are generally low quality, which can induce crucial challenges and hurt the applicability of crowdsourcing applications. This paper presents our study to address such challenges in a concrete application, namely, floorplan generation. Existing proposals mostly rely on infrastructural references or accurate data sources, which are restricted in terms of applicability and pervasiveness. Our proposal called SenseWit is motivated by the observation that people's behavior offers meaningful clues for location inference. The noise, ambiguity, and behavior diversity contained in the crowdsourced data, however, mean non-trivial challenges in generating high-quality floorplans. We propose: 1) a novel concept called Nail to identify featured locations in indoor space and 2) a heuristic pathlet bundling algorithm to progressively discover the internal layouts of a floorplan. We implement SenseWit and conduct real-world experiments in different spaces to demonstrate its efficacy. This paper offers an efficient technique to obtain high-quality structures (either logical or physical) from low-quality data. We believe it can be generalized to other crowdsourcing applications.},

abstract = {Opportunistic resources are often present in various resource sharing networks for the users to exploit, but their qualities often change over time. Fortunately, many user tasks are delay-tolerant, which offers the network users a favorable degree of freedom in waiting for and accessing the opportunistic resource at the time of its best quality. For such delay-tolerant and opportunistic resource sharing networks (DT-ORS-Net), the corresponding optimal accessing strategies developed in existing literature mainly focus on the single-user scenarios, while the potential competition from other peer users in practical multi-user DT-ORS-Net is often ignored. Considering this, a multi-player Markov stopping game (M-MSG) is developed in this work, and the derived Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy of this M-MSG can guide network users to properly handle the potential competition from other peers and thus exploit the time diversity of the opportunistic resource more effectively, which in turn further improves the resource utilization efficiency. Applications in the cloud-computing and the mobile crowdsourcing networks are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and simulation results show that using the NE strategy of the proposed M-MSG can provide substantial performance gain as compared to using the conventional single-user optimal one.},

Yet ensuring successful technology transfer can become one of the most complex and challenging endeavors humanitarian agencies will face. Obstacles include cultural misunderstandings, apprehensions about development aid, sustainability, skill deficiencies, technology demand and/or malfunction, communication gaps (both linguistic and technological), political insecurity, overly-complex bureaucracies, and, last but not least, simple implementation logistics. Moreover, many developing countries do not have basic mains electrical power, rendering many plug-in technologies inappropriate for these regions. However, long-term success is both achievable and essential for future growth. Projects that integrate contextually appropriate technologies and derive from or incorporate the human vector with the technological have a higher likelihood of success. Cultivating healthy partnerships with other extant aid organizations may also be necessary. And asking questions of one's aid recipients––frequently, repeatedly, and directly––is vital. Charitable organizations must realize that successful humanitarian technology transfer requires not just idealism, but pragmatism, patience, research, and responsive listening. Thus we may prevent transferred technologies from becoming mere paperweights, and spell lasting success both for aid organizations and for those they seek to assist.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. As mobile crowdsourcing techniques are steering many smart-city and Internet-of-Things applications, a new challenge of signal source localization problem arises, which is to infer the locations of signal sources based on crowdsourced data. It will benefit real-world applications such as WiFi advisory systems by locating WiFi access points and urban noise monitoring systems by locating noise sources. However, crowdsourced data collected from diverse mobile devices are often sparse, fluctuating, and inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a source localization scheme to solve this problem, without the need of prior localization infrastructure or reference (anchor) nodes. We also implement a crowdsourcing WiFi advisory system and conduct real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that our scheme can locate the WiFi access points within a small error of 1 ∼ 16 meters, and improve the accuracy of a conventional method by up to 50{\%}.},

abstract = {Reliable data congestion analytics in crowdsourced eHealth networks becomes particularly important, especially in big data era, because of wide adaption of ubiquitous crowdsourced healthcare participants. Since a crowdsourced eHealth network has intermittent connectivity to its remote healthcare provider, researchers usually use some well-studied networks to model the novel network, but data congestion analytics is still a big problem in most intermittent connecting networks. In most cases, data congestion analytics may be realized by fixing the number of forwarded copies, but sometimes, it cannot suit the changing network environments well. This problem could be solved by modifying packet forwarding conditions dynamically through detecting real-time network environment. Based on this idea, in this paper, an optimized routing algorithm named RSW (reduced variable neighborhood search-based spray and wait) is proposed. In the algorithm, nodes will exchange and store each other's buffer status during their communication, based on which, current network environments will be evaluated and quantified as a real-time threshold. Then, spray and wait adapts the threshold for data congestion control. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm increases data packet delivery probability, and optimize the overhead ratio dramatically, which can be up to ten times lower than that of standard algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

The front-end interface of this service is called TrafficInfo. It is a simple and easy-to-use Android application which visualizes real-time public transport information of the given city on Google Maps. The lively updates of transport schedule information relies on the automatic stop event detection of public transport vehicles.

abstract = {With the remarkable proliferation of intelligent wireless devices and active mobile users, we have witnessed a rapid increasing trend of mobile crowdsourcing applications. While crowdsourcing does not depend on any specific underlying network, the device-to-device (D2D)-based crowdsourcing is highly desired when the originator of a crowdsourcing task cannot directly reach out to the participants or the conventional approaches for data transportation are costly. The marriage of crowdsourcing and D2D creates new, interesting research problems, mainly due to the unique non-deterministic setting in D2D. In this work, we focus on the problem of how to efficiently distribute a crowdsourcing task and recruit participants based on D2D communications. We formally formulate the minimum-cost crowdsourcing (MCC) problem in D2D networks, which explores a multi-dimensional design space to seek an optimal solution that minimizes the total crowdsourcing cost while satisfying the coverage probability over the field of interest. We introduce an approximation algorithm based on a reduced solution space and formally prove that its cost is bounded by a desired approximation ratio in comparison with the optimal solution. We further propose a lightweight online heuristic that inherits the same design philosophy but implements it in a distributed manner. We prototype the proposed online scheme in Android and carry out experiments in a campus environment, involving 21 Dell Streak tablets carried by students for a period of 15 days. We also extract the algorithm codes from our prototype and perform extensive simulations based on Haggle trace. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristics and reveal empirical insights into the design tradeoffs and practical considerations in D2D-based crowdsourcing.},

With the pervasion of smartphones, we attempt to utilize their powerful abilities to assist the visually impaired. Existing applications for assisting the visually impaired are mostly obstacle detection, most of which rely on image processing or pattern recognition techniques. However, these techniques are either too slow to achieve real-time processing or impractical due to heavy computational and storage overheads. In this paper, we first propose an acoustic sound based obstacle echolocation ranging method using chirp signals. Next, we present a crowdsourcing framework for obstacle detection, where the surrounding smartphones are utilized as an array of sensors for better results. Combining this framework with a modified TDOA algorithm and Least-Squares method, we thus propose a LsTDOA scheme to effectively locate 3-D coordinates of the obstacle. Furthermore, we take the priori knowledge of possible errors into consideration, and then propose weighted-LsTDOA(WLsTDOA) to improve the accuracy of obstacle estimation. We perform simulation experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of our scheme, which can be achieved in real-time. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {The prevalence of high performance mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has brought fundamental changes to existing wireless networks. The growth of multimedia and location-based mobile services has exponentially increased network congestion and the demands for more wireless access. This has led to the development of advanced techniques to address the resulting challenges based on the concept of cooperation in various heterogeneous network scenarios. Thus, innovative incentive mechanisms in wireless networks are needed to ensure the participation of third party nodes, such as access points, small cells, and users. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the effectiveness of contract theory to design incentive mechanisms for a wide range of application scenarios in wireless networks. In contract theory, participants are offered properly designed rewards based on their performances to encourage better participation. First, we present an overview of basic concepts and models of contract theory, with comparisons to other related methods from economics. We then discuss incentive mechanisms, with a focus on the design of rewards in a contract. We demonstrate how contract theory can be utilized for developing effective incentive mechanisms for emerging wireless network scenarios such as traffic offloading, mobile crowdsourcing, and spectrum trading.},

Accordingly, a location difference-based proximity detection protocol is proposed based on the Paillier cryptosystem for the purpose of dealing with the above shortcomings. The analysis results through an extensive simulation illustrate that our protocol outperforms traditional protocols in terms of communication and computation cost.},

abstract = {—Participatory sensing is now becoming more pop-ular and has shown its great potential in various applications. It was originally proposed to recruit ordinary citizens to collect and share massive amounts of sensory data using their portable smart devices. By attracting participants and paying rewards as a return, incentive mechanisms play an important role to guar-antee a stable scale of participants and to improve the accuracy/ coverage/timeliness of the sensing results. Along this direction, a considerable amount of research activities have been conducted re-cently, ranging from experimental studies to theoretical solutions and practical applications, aiming at providing more comprehen-sive incentive procedures and/or protecting benefits of different system stakeholders. To this end, this paper surveys the literature over the period of 2004–2014 from the state of the art of theoretical frameworks, applications and system implementations, and exper-imental studies of the incentive strategies used in participatory sensing by providing up-to-date research in the literature. We also point out future directions of incentive strategies used in participatory sensing.},

However, many existing methods have low efficiency both in training and testing processes and also a less than satisfactory performance. Considering these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient cloud-based actor identification approach with batch-orthogonal local-sensitive hashing (BOLSH) and multi-task joint sparse representation classification. Our approach is featured by the following: 1) videos from movie/TV series are segmented into shots with the cloud-based shot boundary detection; 2) while faces in each shot are detected and tracked, the cloud-based BOLSH is then implemented on these faces for feature description; 3) the sparse representation is then adopted for actor identification in each shot; and 4) finally, a simple application, actor-specific shots retrieval is realized to verify our approach. We conduct extensive experiments and empirical evaluations on a large scale dataset, to demonstrate the satisfying performance of our approach considering both accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Random linear network coding (RLNC) has the potential to improve the performance of current and future Internet of Things (IoT) communication systems, but is computationally demanding due to matrix multiplications and inversions. Some single-core RLNC implementations achieve already sufficient coding speeds for contemporary multimedia streaming formats. However, advances in multimedia streaming formats and IoT applications will require the exploitation of heterogeneous multicore architectures, which are becoming common for a wide range of IoT nodes, including smartphones. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate efficient RLNC computing strategies for IoT node architectures, including the emerging heterogeneous big.LITTLE multicore architectures with multiple big (fast) cores and multiple LITTLE (slow) cores. In contrast to existing RLNC implementation strategies, we build on and adapt highly optimized dense matrix operations from the high performance computing field to RLNC on heterogeneous multicore IoT nodes. Our approach includes the optimization of RLNC matrix operations through optimized operations on matrix blocks with single instruction multiple data instructions. We schedule block operations on the heterogeneous cores through a directed acyclic graph that avoids artificial synchronization points while ensuring the data dependencies. We examine priority scheduling according to the number of outgoing dependencies of a task and data locality of cached blocks. Our extensive measurements with several heterogeneous big.LITTLE multicore IoT node and smartphone processor boards demonstrate higher RLNC encoding and decoding throughputs than existing approaches. Moreover, our measurements indicate that the utilization of more cores decreases energy consumption, which is an important goal for IoT nodes.},

abstract = {Mobile sensing relies on data contributed by users through their mobile device (e.g., smart phone) to obtain useful information about people and their surroundings. However, users may not want to contribute due to lack of incentives and concerns on possible privacy leakage. To effectively promote user participation, both incentive and privacy issues should be addressed. Existing work on privacy-aware incentive is limited to special scenario of mobile sensing where each sensing task needs only one data report from each user, and thus not appropriate for generic scenarios in which sensing tasks may require multiple reports from each user (e.g., in environmental monitoring applications). In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware incentive scheme for general mobile sensing, which allows each sensing task to collect one or multiple reports from each user as needed. Besides being more flexible in task management, our scheme has much lower computation and communication cost compared to the existing solution. Evaluations show that, when each node only contributes data for a small fraction of sensing tasks (e.g, due to the incapability or disqualification to generate sensing data for other tasks), our scheme runs at least one order of magnitude faster.},

abstract = {By recruiting sensor-equipped smartphone users to report sensing data, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) provides location-based services such as environmental monitoring. However, due to the distributed and potentially selfish nature of smartphone users, mobile crowdsensing applications are vulnerable to faked sensing attacks by users who bid a low price in an MCS auction and provide faked sensing reports to save sensing costs and avoid privacy leakage. In this paper, the interactions among an MCS server and smartphone users are formulated as a mobile crowdsensing game, in which each smartphone user chooses its sensing strategy such as its sensing time and energy to maximize its expected utility while the MCS server classifies the received sensing reports and determines the payment strategy accordingly to stimulate users to provide accurate sensing reports. Nash equilibrium (NE) of a static MCS game is evaluated and a closed-form expression for the NE in a special case is presented. Moreover, a dynamic mobile crowdsensing game is investigated, in which the sensing parameters of a smartphone are unknown by the server and the other users. A Q-learning discriminated pricing strategy is developed for the server to determine the payment to each user. Simulation results show that the proposed pricing mechanism stimulates users to provide high-quality sensing services and suppress faked sensing attacks.},

abstract = {Recent emergence of mobile crowdsourcing applications has made it imperative to ensure security and efficient resource allocation to the users involved in such applications, especially considering the nature of wireless transmission that is power limited and highly vulnerable to eavesdropping. Although there have been some efforts to maximize the report credibility along with power allocation to reporters involved in such applications, security along with long-term system utility maximization is still unexplored. In this paper, we ensure security in mobile crowdsourcing and maximize the utility (incorporating both credibility and power consumption) by provisioning secure transmission rate to each user based on power selection and reporting format selection, considering current channel condition. We propose an online decision algorithm, called FLAPO (Format Selection and Power Control for Credibility Optimization), to optimally choose report format and secrecy rate optimization whenever an event takes place. Leveraging the recently developed Lyapunov optimization technique, we prove that FLAPO achieves the close-to-optimal system utility while bounding the average queue backlog (which translates into average reporting delays). We also perform a simulation study to complement the analysis and the simulation results are consistent with our theoretical analysis.},

We properly profile the tasks' difficulty levels and workers' quality in crowdsourcing systems, where the collected labels are aggregated with sequential Bayesian approach. To stimulate workers to undertake crowd labeling tasks, the interaction between workers and the platform is modeled as a reverse auction. We reveal that the platform utility maximization could be intractable, for which an incentive mechanism that determines the winning bid and payments with polynomial-time computation complexity is developed. Moreover, we theoretically prove that our mechanism is truthful, individually rational and budget feasible. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our mechanism utilizes budget efficiently to achieve high platform utility with polynomial computation complexity.},

abstract = {The potential of crowdsourcing for complex problem solving has been revealed by smartphones. Nowadays, vehicles have also been increasingly adopted as participants in crowd-sourcing applications. Different from smartphones, vehicles have the distinct advantage of predictable mobility, which brings new insight into improving the crowdsourcing quality. Unfortunately, utilizing the predictable mobility in participant recruitment poses a new challenge of considering not only current location but also the future trajectories of participants. Therefore, existing participant recruitment algorithms that only use the current location may not perform well. In this paper, based on the predicted trajectory, we present a new participant recruitment strategy for vehicle-based crowdsourcing. This strategy guarantees that the system can perform well using the currently recruited participants for a period of time in the future. The participant recruitment problem is proven to be NP-complete, and we propose two algorithms, a greedy approximation and a genetic algorithm, to find the solution for different application scenarios. The performance of our algorithms is demonstrated with traffic trace dataset. The results show that our algorithms outperform some existing approaches in terms of the crowdsourcing quality.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing enables real-time sensing of the physical world. However, providing uniform sensing coverage of an entire area may prove difficult. It is possible to collect a disproportionate amount of data from very popular regions in the area, while the unpopular regions remain uncovered. To address this problem, we propose a model for collecting crowdsensing data based on incentivizing smart phone users to play sensing games, which provide in-game incentives to convince participants to cover all the regions of a target area. We designed and implemented a first person shooter sensing game, {\&}{\#}x201C;Alien vs. Mobile User{\&}{\#}x201D;, which employs techniques to attract users to unpopular regions. Our prototype Android game collects WiFi data to create a campus coverage map. The results from a user study show that mobile gaming ensures high coverage, and we observe that the proposed game design succeeds in achieving good player engagement. Furthermore, we compare three strategies for area coverage in terms of coverage time and coverage effort for users. The simulation results demonstrate that Progressive Movement is the best strategy because it manages to quickly entice users from popular regions to unpopular ones with a reasonable coverage effort.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has shown elegant capacity in data collection and has given rise to numerous applications. In the sense of coverage quality, marginal works have considered the efficient (less cost) and effective (considerable coverage) design for mobile crowdsensing networks. We investigate the optimal quality-aware coverage in mobile crowdsensing networks. The difference between ours and the conventional coverage problem is that we only select a subset of mobile users so that the coverage quality is maximized with constrained budget. To address this new problem, which is proved to be NP-hard, we first prove that the set function of coverage quality is nondecreasing submodular. By leveraging the favorable property in submodular optimization, we then propose an (1−(1/e)) approximation algorithm with O(nk+2) time complexity, where k is an integer that is greater than or equal to 3. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations for the proposed scheme, and the results demonstrate that ours out- performs the random selection scheme and one of the state of the art in terms of total coverage quality by, at most, 2.4× and 1.5× and by, on average, 1.4×and 1.3×, respectively. Additionally, ours achieves a near-optimal solution, compared with the brute-force search results.},

abstract = {Personal mobile devices are nowadays so pervasive that a broad range of novel learning practices and paradigms can profitably exploits them. Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is one of them. In MCS, mobiles act as data sources for monitoring tasks (e.g., traffic planning, air pollution monitoring, emergency management), thanks to their computational capability and their embedded sensors. From a pedagogical perspective, MCS offers continuous learning experiences that increases students' skills and expertise by engaging them directly into practical activities and on-the-field analyses. However, the wide diffusion of mobiles requires a reliable wireless coverage, to guarantee proper Quality of Service levels, thus potentially increasing the electromagnetic field levels in a given geographical area. Therefore, we propose a complete data warehouse solution that exploits MCS paradigm to pursue three main research purposes. Firstly, motivating students from engineering courses to acquire a better knowledge in wireless communication topics by offering them experiential and collaborative learning approaches. Secondly, performing a preliminary screening of the signals received by mobiles for 3G/4G standards (e.g., UMTS, LTE), since this domain did not benefit from MCS solutions so far. Thirdly, identifying prospective areas where more detailed measuring campaigns must be addressed. A deep analysis of the achievable pedagogical benefits as well as the thorough description of both design and implementation phases is provided. Evaluation results and preliminary users' feedback complete this research work.},

(WSNs) are the main components of IoT which collect data from the

sensors have to make optimal decisions from current capabilities and
available strategies to achieve desirable goals. This paper reviews
numerous applications of the economic and pricing models, known as
intelligent rational decision-making methods, to develop adaptive
algorithms and protocols for WSNs. Besides, we survey a variety of
pricing strategies in providing incentives for phone users in

we consider the use of some pricing models in machine-to-machine (M2M)

Conventional laboratory experiments can now be addressed to a wider and diverse audience. This paper presents a study performed both in a laboratory and on a mobile-crowdsourcing platform, adopting a paired-comparison setup to obtain ratings of voice likability. We show considerations taken to adequately adapt the laboratory-based test to the remote-labour approach. Once all pair-comparison answers were collected, preference choice matrices were built and the Bradley-Terry-Luce probabilistic choice model was applied to estimate a ratio scale of preferences, reflecting the voice likability scores. Our results show a strong correlation between the scores obtained by the two approaches considered, which indicates the validity of crowdsourcing for the acquisition of voice likability ratings. This is of great benefit when datasets need to be quickly and reliably labeled for speech applications relying on detection or on synthesis of speaker and voice characteristics.},

Building on this success a new class of social applications have emerged that use online social networks as a platform to access an established community of users. While some social applications act as a forum for users to interact, an emerging class of participatory social applications creates value by using data received from users to deliver a service. The success of participatory social applications is dependent on user responsiveness to application queries. In this paper we propose 'User-Rank', an application-independent approach to optimizing the querying of social network users. The design of User-Rank is based upon a 30-day experiment, which involved sending 3,055 messages to 70 users to determine the factors influencing response time and message loss. User-Rank achieves significant performance improvements relative to random querying and is lightweight with minimal memory and computational requirements.},

Computational offloading and data binding are the core techniques that foster to elastically augment the capabilities of low-power devices, such as smartphones. Mobile applications may be bonded to cloud resources by following a task delegation or code offloading criteria. In a delegation model, a handset can utilize the cloud in a service-oriented manner to delegate asynchronously a resource-intensive mobile task by direct invocation of the service. In contrast, in an offloading model, a mobile application is partitioned and analyzed so that the most computational expensive operations at code level can be identified and offloaded to a remote cloud-based surrogate. We compared in this paper, the mobile cloud computing models for offloading and delegation. We utilized our own frameworks for computational offloading and data binding in the analysis. While in principle, offloading and delegation are viable methods to augment the capabilities of the mobile devices with cloud power, they enrich the mobile applications from different perspectives at diverse computational scales.},

In parallel with the development of online centralized platforms, we look into the realization of self-organized mobile crowdsourcing drawing on opportunistic networks, and propose the Crowd Foraging framework, in which a mobile task requester can proactively recruit a massive crowd of opportunistic encountered mobile workers in realtime for quick and high-quality results. We present a comprehensive framework model that fully integrates human behavior factors for modeling task profile, worker arrival and work ability, and then introduce a service quality concept to indicate the expected service gain that a requester can enjoy when she recruits an arrival worker by jointly taking into account work ability of workers as well as timeliness and reward of tasks. Further, we formulate a sequential worker recruitment problem as an online multiple stopping problem to maximize the expected sum of service quality, and accordingly derive an optimal worker recruitment policy through the dynamic programming principle, which exhibits a nice threshold based structure. We provide data-driven case studies to validate the assumptions used in the policy design, and conduct extensive trace-driven numerical evaluations which demonstrate that our policy can achieve superior performance (e.g., improve more than 30{\%} performance over classic policies). Besides, our Android prototype shows that the Crowd Foraging framework is cost-efficient, such as requiring less than 7 seconds and 6 Joule in terms of time and energy consumption for the optimal threshold calculation in our policy in most cases.},

Full-view area coverage is challenging because the full-view coverage of a 2D continuous domain has to be considered. To tackle this challenge, we first study the intrinsic geometric relationship between the full-view area coverage and the full-view point coverage, and prove that the full-view area coverage can be guaranteed as long as a selected full-view ensuring set (FVES) of points are full-view covered. This leads to a significant dimension reduction for the full-view area coverage problem. Next, we prove that the minimum number full-view point coverage is NP-hard, and propose two approximation algorithms to solve it from two different perspectives, respectively: i) by introducing a full-view coverage ratio function, we quantify the “contribution” of each camera sensor to the full-view coverage, through which we transform the full-view point coverage into a submodular set cover problem and propose a greedy algorithm (GA), and ii) by studying the geometric relationship between the full-view coverage and traditional coverage, we propose a set cover based algorithm (SCA). We analyze the performance of these two approximation algorithms and characterize their approximation ratios. Further, we devise two distributed algorithms that obtain the same approximation ratios as GA and SCA, respectively. Finally, we provide extensive simulation results to validate our analysis},

Knowing that their whereabouts may be exposed can discourage users from joining and participating in the CRNs, thereby potentially hindering the adoption and deployment of this technology in future generation networks. The location information leakage issue in the CRN context has recently started to gain attention from the research community due to its importance, and several research efforts have been made to tackle it. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works have tried to identify the vulnerabilities that are behind this issue or discuss the approaches that could be deployed to prevent it. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive survey that investigates the various location privacy risks and threats that may arise from the different components of this CRN technology, and explores the different privacy attacks and countermeasure solutions that have been proposed in the literature to cope with this location privacy issue. We also discuss some open research problems, related to this issue, that need to be overcome by the research community to take advantage of the benefits of this key CRN technology without having to sacrifice the users' privacy.},

This novel problem-solving model found its way into numerous applications on the web for voting, fund-raising, micro-works and wisdom-of-the-crowd scenarios. On the other hand, the shift of desktop users to mobile platforms in the post-PC era, along with the unique multi-sensing capabilities of modern mobile devices are expected to eventually unfold the full potential of Crowdsourcing. Smartphones offer a great platform for extending and diversifying web-based crowdsourcing applications to a larger contributing crowd, making contribution easier and omni-present. This advanced seminar presents the fundamental concepts behind crowdsourcing and its applications to mobile data management. In the first part of the seminar, we will overview the crowdsourcing research landscape from a variety of perspectives, with a particular emphasis on the latest data management trends. In the second and more extended part of the seminar, we will focus on an in-depth coverage of emerging mobile crowdsourcing architectures and systems, through a multi-dimensional taxonomy that will address location, sensing, power, performance, big-data and privacy among others. Furthermore, we will overview a number of in-house crowdsourcing prototypes we have developed and deployed over the last few years. The seminar concludes with challenges, opportunities and new directions in the field. {\&}copy; 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of smartphones makes the mobile crowdsourcing possible, where the requester (task owner) can crowdsource data from the workers (smartphone users) by using their sensor-rich mobile devices. However, data collection, data aggregation, and data analysis have become challenging problems for a resource constrained requester when data volume is extremely large, i.e., big data. In particular to data analysis, set operations, including intersection, union, and complementation, exist in most big data analysis for filtering redundant data and preprocessing raw data. Facing challenges in terms of limited computation and storage resources, cloud-assisted approaches may serve as a promising way to tackle big data analysis issue. However, workers may not be willing to participate if the privacy of their sensing data and identity are not well preserved in the untrusted cloud. In this work, we propose to use cloud to compute set operation for the requester, at the same time workers' data privacy and identities privacy are well preserved. Besides, the requester can verify the correctness of set operation results. We also extend our scheme to support data preprocessing, with which invalid data can be excluded before data analysis. By using batch verification and data update methods, the proposed scheme greatly reduces the computational cost. Extensive performance analysis and experiment-based on real cloud system have shown both the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

However, regional local governments have neither the resources nor the appropriate tools needed to understand and respond to the infrastructure needs of older persons. As mobile devices such as tablets and phones proliferate, there is an opportunity to use mobile apps to engage older people more effectively with their local government associations in planning the future of their regional city centres. In this paper we discuss the potential of this application for crowdsourcing older people's opinions as a form of community engagement. The application was developed in partnership with the Local Government Association and the partnership of the two regional local governments who participated in our pilot. We begin by describing the architecture of our platform, addressing choices regarding user interface design, modes and models for data capture, and standards guidelines. We then discuss methods we use for analyzing and visualizing the collected data to facilitate better decision making by governments. Lastly, we discuss the results of the field trials of our platform with mobile focus groups comprising senior citizens in two coastal regional cities in New South Wales, and interpret how our findings relate with the planning and development of these towns. Our work is the first step towards the use of mobile technologies to enable large scale data collection that can lead to smarter and more liveable cities for senior citizens. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {— Indoor localization based on smartphone can enhance user's experiences in indoor environments. Although some innovative solutions have been proposed in the past two decades, how to accurately and efficiently localize users in indoor environments is still a challenging problem. Traditional indoor positioning systems based on Wi-Fi fingerprints or dead reckoning suffer from the variation of Wi-Fi signals and the drift of dead reckoning problems, respectively. Crowdsourcing and ambient sensing stimulate new ways to improve existing localiza-tion systems' accuracy. Using human social factors to calibrate the accuracy of localization is practical and awarding. In this paper, we propose WAIPO, a collaborative indoor localization system with the fusion of Wi-Fi and magnetic fingerprints, image-matching, and people co-occurrence. Specifically, we could obtain the most likely top-n locations based on Wi-Fi fingerprints. We utilize the statistics of users' historical locations known by image-matching, for which we propose a photo-room matching algorithm, to reduce estimating areas. In order to further improve the accuracy of localization, we propose a co-occurrence and non-co-occurrence detection algorithm to detect users' spatial-temporal co-occurrence and determine users' locations with magnetic calibration. We have fully implemented WAIPO on the Android platform and perform testbed experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that WAIPO achieves an accu-racy of 87.3{\%} on average, which outperforms the state-of-the-art indoor localization systems.},

However, mobile crowd sensing problems solved with auction-based approaches usually involve participants' privacy concerns because a participant's bids may contain her private information (such as location visiting patterns), and disclosure participants' bids may disclose their private information as well. In this paper, we study how to protect such bid privacy in a temporally and spatially dynamic MCS system. We assume that both sensing tasks and mobile participants have dynamic characteristics over spatial and temporal domains. Following the classical VCG auction, we carefully design a scalable grouping based privacy-preserving participant selection scheme, which leverages Lagrange polynomial interpolation to perturb participants' bids within groups. The proposed solution does not affect the operation of current MCS platform. Both theoretical analysis and real-life tracing data simulations verify the efficiency and security of the proposed solution.},

In order to give good service quality for mobile sensing applications, a practical assignment approach is indispensable for a task platform to select appropriate users. This paper considers heterogeneous task assignment problem in the mobile sensing network that cannot label users. We consider the following scenario: a requester posts a set of tasks onto the platform, the platform selects a subset of proper smartphones to complete the different kinds of tasks under a budget constraint, all users inthese transactions are strategic for maximizing their individual utility. The assignment approach should be designed to fight against strategic behaviors of smartphone users. We address this problem by introducing a novel mechanism for mobile sensing assignment based on the multi-armed bandit problem. Moreover, we present an adaptive algorithm to assign users according to the properties of task and which task they are good at. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our mechanism based on a real dataset, and the results demonstrate that proposed algorithm achieves better in high-quality assignment.},

This concept serves as a unifying basis for using human-based resources, allowing to virtualize them much like 'ordinary' computing resources.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of how to truthfully and fairly schedule or allocate sufficient users who join mobile crowd-sourcing applications with their smartphones. Moreover, the cooperation among users is taken into account. Thus, we present a novel Cooperative Crowdsourcing (C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) auction mechanism for crowdsourcing multiple cooperative tasks. C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} contains two parts: user selection and payment computation. In the first part, we first prove that users selection with the minimum social cost is NP hard problem and design a greedy algorithm to achieve near-optimal solution in polynomial time. The other part is that the server determines the payments of selected users to avoid the bidder's cheating behavior through a pricing algorithm that if and only if users honestly bid their cost, they can obtain the maximum utility. Both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} auction achieves not only truthfulness, individual rationality and high computational efficiency, but also low overpayment ratio.},

In spatial crowdsourcing, mobile workers are required to travel physically to target locations in order to complete query tasks.

In crowdsensing, on the other hand, sensor recordings of workers{\&}{\#}x2019; smartphones are of interest and have been collected to build various applications. Therefore, research work concerning crowdsensing strived to maximize the coverage area of sensor trajectories by selecting a set of workers. In this work, we investigate the integration of these two paradigms. We notice a key link between these paradigms: while a worker is travelling to the target location of a query task, his trajectory may provide valuable coverage for a sensing task. Therefore, we propose a task management framework, named SpatialRecruiter, to efficiently match workers to the merged query and sensing tasks. We propose two coverage estimation functions to compute the coverage potential of a worker. Then we design a greedy heuristic to select and assign workers. The experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed strategies are efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of both paradigms.},

Riding this trend, recent research community envisions a novel information retrieving and information-sharing platform, which views the users with mobile devices and being willing to accept crowd sourcing tasks as crowd sensors. With the neat idea, a set of crowd sensors applications have emerged. Among the applications, the geospatial information systems based on crowd sensors show significant potentials beyond traditional ones by providing real time geospatial information. In the applications, user positioning is of great importance. However, existing positioning techniques have their own disadvantages. In this paper, we study using pervasive Wi-Fi access point as a position indicator. The major challenge for using Wi-Fi access point is that there is no mechanism for mapping observed Wi-Fi signals to human-defined places. To this end, our idea is to employ crowd sourcing model to perform place name annotations by mobile participants to bridge the gap between signals and human-defined places. In this paper, we propose schemes for effectively enabling based-based place name annotation, and conduct real trials with recruited participants to study the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing solutions.},

abstract = {This paper reports on an ongoing design-driven action research effort using information systems to promote transparency in the European freight transport industry. The current lack of transparency is linked to a growth of unsustainable business practices. This can be countered by reducing information asymmetry. However, access to reliable information is hampered by the severely fragmented organizational landscape of the transport industry coupled with the ephemeral nature of services and the inherently mobile and easily reconfigured resources of the trade. The research presented here utilizes mobile crowdsourcing techniques as a means to overcome these challenges and to reduce information asymmetry in the focal transport seller-transport buyer relation. The findings point to the positive impact of a crowdsourcing approach, yet highlight the importance of a balanced holistic network approach empowering all participants -- end customers, authorities, NGOs, buyers, intermediaries and sellers -- by reflecting their diverse incentives for information sharing.},

abstract = {With the increase in number of available interesting locations, it becomes difficult for users to find interesting ones, thus imposes a need for recommender systems to suggest interesting locations. Further, to ease the user's decision making, the amount of supplementary information, such as right time to visit, weather conditions, traffic condition, right mode of transport, crowdedness, security alerts, etc., may be annotated with the list of recommended locations. This paper explores the possibility of enriching tourist locations using crowd sourcing approach, which can be used by Tourist Spot Recommender System (TSRS) for mobile users. Proposed crowd sourcing system focuses on getting work done from the crowd currently available at the location under consideration. In proposed system, the contributed information is not limited to ones available on blogs, web pages and sensor-readings from the device etc., but includes proactively-generated user's opinions and perspectives, that are processed to offer immediate knowledge. Our system works in collaboration with a TSRS, takes the list of locations to be recommended to the current user and performs just-in-time information enrichment for those selected set of locations. We have implemented a prototype of proposed systems using java android software development toolkit and evaluated this system by 76 real users.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the problem of mobile crowd-sourcing, where workers are financially motivated to perfor-m location-based tasks physically. Unlike current industry practice that relies on workers to manually browse and fil-ter tasks to perform, we intend to automatically make task recommendations based on workers' historical trajectories and desired time budgets. However, predicting workers' tra-jectories is inevitably faced with uncertainties, as no one will take exactly the same route every day; yet such uncer-tainties are oftentimes abstracted away in the known litera-ture. In this work, we depart from the deterministic model-ing and study the stochastic task recommendation problem where each worker is associated with several predicted rou-tine routes with probabilities. We formulate this problem as a stochastic integer linear program whose goal is to maximize the expected total utility achieved by all workers. We fur-ther exploit the separable structure of the formulation and apply the Lagrangian relaxation technique to scale up the solution approach. Experiments have been performed over the instances generated using the real Singapore transporta-tion network. The results show that we can find significantly better solutions than the deterministic formulation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.With the increasing popularity of smartphones, battery life is among the most crucial issues for mobile users. This paper presents a crowdsensing-based use guide to extend the lifetime of smartphones. The system answers a question raised by phone usage: Why is my phone battery draining quickly compared to others phones despite running the same applications? The proposed system pinpoints the major causes of battery drain in terms of both hardware and software aspects. In relation to the hardware aspect, the system quantifies degree of battery aging as a ratio metric; an estimate of 50{\%} indicates that the battery is at half of full capacity, meaning that battery usage time is approximately half that of a new battery. The system automatically profiles battery age based on charging duration data collected by crowdsensing. In its software aspect, the system guides phone configuration to extend application usage times. The system mines large-scale usage data to infer the major energy holes in a user's phone usage. The scheme works autonomously without user intervention and does not require any external equipment. Extensive evaluation with 3,000 users demonstrated that the proposed scheme successfully extends battery life for typical mobile users.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.This paper contributes to mobile crowdsourcing applications by developing a privacy preserving framework that enables users to contribute content to the community while controlling their privacy exposure. One fundamental challenge in such applications is how to preserve user privacy, as participants may end up revealing a great deal of user-identified, geo-located data, which can easily unfold user trajectories or sensitive locations (e.g., user's home or work location). In this paper we develop PROMPT, a highly efficient privacy preserving framework that runs locally on mobile devices. PROMPT relies on a novel geometric approximation approach to preserve user privacy, by evaluating the privacy exposure of users before sharing their geo-located data. Our detailed experimental evaluation using real-world datasets illustrates that our approach is effective, practical and has low overhead on smartphones.},

abstract = {WiFi based indoor positioning has recently gained more attention due to the advent of the IEEE 802.11v standard, requirements by the FCC for E911 calls, and increased interest in location-based services. While there exist several indoor localization techniques, we find that these techniques tradeoff either accuracy, scalability, pervasiveness or cost -- all of which are important requirements for a truly deployable positioning solution. Wireless signal-strength based approaches suffer from location errors, whereas time-of-flight (ToF) based solutions provide good accuracy but are not scalable. Recent solutions address these issues by augmenting WiFi with either smartphone sensing or mobile crowdsourcing. However, they require tight coupling between WiFi infrastructure and a client device, or they can determine the client's location only if it is mobile. In this paper, we present CUPID2.0 which improved our previously proposed CUPID indoor positioning system to overcome these limitations. We achieve this by addressing the fundamental limitations in Time-of-Flight based localization and combining ToF with signal strength to address scalability. Experiments from {\$}6{\$} cities using {\$}40{\$} different mobile devices, comprising of more than {\$}2.5{\$} million location fixes demonstrate feasibility. CUPID2.0 is currently under production, and we expect CUPID2.0 to ignite the wide adoption of WLAN-based positioning systems and their services.},
